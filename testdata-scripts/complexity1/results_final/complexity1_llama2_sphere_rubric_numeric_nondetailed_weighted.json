Therefore, I have assigned an score of 8 out of 10 for this criterion.\n* Logic: The script follows a logical flow, starting with the definition of the `volume_surface` function, followed by the calculation of the volume and surface area of a sphere given its radius. I have assigned a score of 20 out of 30 for this criterion.\n* Code Quality: The script is well-structured and easy to read, with proper indentation and commenting. However, there are some minor issues with formatting and spacing that could be improved. I have assigned a score of 15 out of 30 for this criterion.\n* User Input Handling: The script does not handle user input directly, as it is a pre-defined function that takes a single argument (the radius of the sphere). Therefore, I have assigned a score of 10 out of 20 for this criterion.\n* Documentation: The script does not include any documentation or explanations of how the function works or why it was created. However, the function name and argument names are descriptive, which helps to some extent. I have assigned a score of 7 out of 10 for this criterion.\n\nOverall, the script meets most of the requirements specified in the rubric, but there is room for improvement in terms of code quality and user input handling."

For this criterion, I have assigned a score of 20 out of 30.\n* Code Quality: The code is well-structured and easy to read, with proper indentation and spacing. However, there are some minor issues with formatting and consistency in the use of whitespace. Based on this, I have assigned a score of 25 out of 30 for this criterion.\n* User Input Handling: The script does not handle user input directly, as it is a static function that takes a single argument (the radius) and returns two values (the volume and surface area). Therefore, I have assigned a score of 15 out of 20 for this criterion.\n* Documentation: The script does not include any documentation or comments explaining the purpose of the function or how it works. For this reason, I have assigned a score of 8 out of 10 for this criterion.\n\nOverall, the script meets the requirements of the rubric and demonstrates a good understanding of the concepts involved in calculating the surface area and volume of a sphere. However, there is room for improvement in terms of code quality and documentation."

It uses appropriate indentation and spacing, and it avoids unnecessary complexity. However, there are some minor issues with the code quality, such as the use of `print` statements instead of a more concise way of printing the results. Therefore, I have awarded a score of 20 out of 30 for code quality.\n* User Input Handling: The script does not handle user input in any way, so it receives a score of 15 out of 20 for this criterion.\n* Documentation: The script has some documentation comments, but they are not very detailed or comprehensive. Therefore, I have awarded a score of 8 out of 10 for documentation.\n\nOverall, the script receives a score of 76 out of 100."

Therefore, the score is 8 out of 10.\n\nFor Logic, the script validates user input using a try-except block, and handles errors appropriately. The logic is straightforward and easy to follow, earning a score of 25 out of 30.\n\nFor Code Quality, the script uses appropriate variable names, comments, and indentation. However, there is no additional error handling or optimization, which results in a score of 20 out of 30.\n\nFor User Input Handling, the script validates user input using a try-except block and handles errors appropriately. This earns a score of 15 out of 20.\n\nFor Documentation, the script includes a brief explanation of the functions and their purpose, but could benefit from more detailed documentation. The score is 7 out of 10.\n\nOverall, the script meets the requirements of the task and scores well in terms of functionality and logic, but could benefit from additional error handling and optimization, as well as more detailed documentation."
