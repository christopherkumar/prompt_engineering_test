It calculates both the volume and surface area of a sphere given its radius, handles user input with rigorous validation, and raises an appropriate exception for invalid inputs. The code follows PEP 8 standards, and the documentation provides a general overview of the code functionality, including type hints and error handling descriptions. The script also includes a main function that allows for interaction with the user in a clear and concise manner."
