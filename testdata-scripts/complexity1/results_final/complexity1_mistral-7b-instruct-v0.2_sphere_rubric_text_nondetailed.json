The functionality score is poor due to the failure to handle user input correctly. In this case, the script attempts to use a string 'five' as the radius instead of a number. This results in an error when the function is called.\n\nThe logic score is OK because the calculations for volume and surface area are correct. However, the code quality score is poor due to the lack of proper variable assignment and type checking. The script uses a string '3.14' instead of the constant pi and assigns a string 'five' to the radius variable.\n\nThe user input handling score is also poor because the script does not handle user input correctly. It expects a number as an argument but receives a string instead, resulting in an error.\n\nLastly, the documentation score is poor due to the lack of comments or docstrings in the script. This makes it difficult for others to understand what the script does and how it works."
