It also includes error handling for invalid user input (negative radius). The functionality is excellent as it meets the requirements of the assignment. The logic is perfect as there are no logical errors in the code. The code quality is competent, as there is room for improvement in terms of naming conventions and formatting. User input handling is excellent as it handles user input with error checking and provides clear instructions to the user. Documentation is good as it includes a brief description of the script and each function."
