It uses the `math` module to access `math.pi`, which is a standard way of handling pi in Python. However, there could be some improvements in terms of variable naming (e.g., `v` and `sa` are not descriptive enough). (Score: 4)\n  \n- **User Input Handling**: The script handles user input by directly assigning a value to the `radius` variable without any validation or error handling for non-numeric or out-of-range inputs. It only works with a single, predefined radius value. (Score: 3)\n  \n- **Documentation**: The script includes comments that explain the purpose of the function and the calculations performed within it. However, the variable names could be more descriptive to improve readability and understanding of the code. (Score: 4)"

The input validation within the `sphere_analysis` function ensures that only positive values are processed, which aligns with the mathematical definition of a sphere's radius.\n\nUser input handling is well executed with clear instructions provided to the user and robust error handling that catches non-numeric inputs and negative values. The script also provides informative feedback to the user in case of an error.\n\nThe documentation within the docstrings is comprehensive, explaining not only the purpose of each function but also the expected input types and the output format. Additionally, the main block of code is well commented, making it clear and understandable for someone reading the script."

It meets all the functional requirements specified in the assignment. (Score: 5)\n  \n- **Logic**: The logic is implemented correctly, with separate functions for calculating volume and surface area, and a main function that handles user input and calls these calculations. The error handling for non-positive radii is also well-implemented. (Score: 5)\n\n- **Code Quality**: The code is clean and follows Python conventions. It uses type annotations and raises appropriate exceptions. However, it could be improved by breaking down the calculation into smaller functions to enhance readability. (Score: 4)\n\n- **User Input Handling**: The script handles user input effectively, prompting for input and catching potential `ValueError` exceptions. It provides a clear error message when an invalid input is given. (Score: 5)\n\n- **Documentation**: The script includes a comprehensive docstring for the main function and well-documented parameter descriptions in the `calculate_sphere_volume_surface` function. However, the docstrings could be more detailed regarding expected input formats and output formats. (Score: 4)"
