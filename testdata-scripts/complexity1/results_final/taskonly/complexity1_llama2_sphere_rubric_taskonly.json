The logic of the task is implemented correctly, as the script calculates the volume and area of a sphere given its radius. The code quality is good, with proper indentation and formatting. However, there are some minor issues with the documentation and user input handling. For example, there is no comment explaining what the `vsphere()` function does, and the input validation for the `radius` parameter could be improved (e.g., using `input()` instead of hardcoding a value). Overall, the script meets most of the criteria in the rubric, but could benefit from some additional attention to detail."

For example, the use of `math.pi` without a explicit import statement is a minor issue, but it could be improved upon.\n* User Input Handling: The script handles user input correctly by taking in a radius as an argument and returning the volume and surface area. However, there is no error handling or feedback to the user if their input is invalid, which is a minor issue.\n* Documentation: The script has some documentation in the form of comments, but it could be improved upon.
