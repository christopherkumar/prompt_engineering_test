It computes the sphere's volume and surface area based on user input and handles invalid input gracefully.\n- Logic: The logic flow is clear and accurate. The mathematical calculations are correct, and the script follows a logical structure.\n- Code Quality: The code is well-structured and mostly adheres to PEP 8 standards. There are minor style inconsistencies.\n- User Input Handling: The user input handling is robust with comprehensive validation and error management.\n- Documentation: The script includes adequate documentation, providing a general overview of the code functionality. However, it could benefit from more detailed explanations for each function and variable."
