        "raw_response": "Based on the provided rubric, I have assessed the Python script as follows:\n\nFunctionality: OK\nThe script implements a function `elite_sphere_calculator` that calculates the volume and surface area of a sphere given its radius. The function validates the input radius and returns the calculated values in a tuple. However, the script does not provide any additional functionality beyond this basic calculation.\n\nLogic: Excellent\nThe script's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the formulae for calculating the volume and surface area of a sphere. The use of `math.pi` for pi is appropriate and consistent with best practices.\n\nCode Quality: Competent\nThe code is well-structured, and the functions are clearly defined. However, there are some minor issues with formatting and indentation that could be improved. For example, the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block could be indented more consistently.\n\nUser Input Handling: Excellent\nThe script handles user input correctly by validating the input radius and raising an error message if it is non-positive. This demonstrates a good understanding of how to handle user input in a Python script.\n\nDocumentation: Competent\nThe script includes a brief documentation string that explains the purpose of the `elite_sphere_calculator` function. However, more detailed documentation could be added to provide additional context and explanations for the function's parameters and return values.\n\nBased on these assessments, I would give the following scores:\n\nFunctionality: OK (2/5)\nLogic: Excellent (4/5)\nCode Quality: Competent (3/5)\nUser Input Handling: Excellent (4/5)\nDocumentation: Competent (3/5)\n\nTotal score: 14/20"
