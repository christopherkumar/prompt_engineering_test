However, there are some minor issues with the logic and code quality that prevent it from achieving a perfect score.\n\nLogic: 3\nThe script has adequate logical structure and applies mathematical concepts correctly, but there are some minor inefficiencies and errors. The implementation could be more efficient and accurate.\n\nCode Quality: 4\nThe code is well-structured and readable, but there are some minor violations of PEP 8 standards. With some improvements in organization and formatting, the code could be even better.\n\nUser Input Handling: 4\nThe script provides good input handling and robust validation and error management, making it user-friendly and reliable.\n\nDocumentation: 3\nThe script has adequate documentation, providing a general overview of its functionality. However, some sections could benefit from more detail and examples.\n\nOverall, the script scores 3.5 out of 5 in terms of functionality, logic, code quality, user input handling, and documentation."
