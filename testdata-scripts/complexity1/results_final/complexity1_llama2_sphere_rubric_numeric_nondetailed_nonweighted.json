Therefore, it scores a 4 out of 5 for functionality.\n* Logic: The script uses mathematical formulas to calculate the volume and surface area of a sphere, which is correct and follows the logic of the problem. It scores a 4 out of 5 for logic.\n* Code Quality: The script has some minor issues with indentation and spacing, but it is generally well-written and easy to read. It scores a 3 out of 5 for code quality.\n* User Input Handling: The script does not handle user input correctly, as it prints an error message when the `calculation` function is called without defining it. It scores a 3 out of 5 for user input handling.\n* Documentation: The script does not include any documentation or comments to explain its functionality or usage. It scores a 2 out of 5 for documentation."

The user input handling is also correct, as the script takes in a single argument (the radius) and returns both the volume and surface area of the sphere. However, the documentation could be improved by providing more information about what each variable represents and how they are used in the calculation."

It also handles the error correctly by raising a `ValueError` when the radius is negative. Therefore, the script achieves a perfect score in functionality.\n* Logic: The script's logic is correct, as it uses the formula for the volume and surface area of a sphere to calculate these quantities. There are no errors or inconsistencies in the script's logic.\n* Code Quality: The script has good code quality, with proper indentation, consistent naming conventions, and minimal use of magic numbers. However, it could benefit from additional comments to explain the purpose of each function and variable. Therefore, the score for code quality is 4 out of 5.\n* User Input Handling: The script handles user input correctly by raising a `ValueError` when the radius is negative. This demonstrates good error handling and achieves a score of 4 out of 5.\n* Documentation: The script has minimal documentation, with only a brief explanation of what the function does. While this is better than no documentation at all, it could benefit from additional comments to provide more context and explain how to use the function. Therefore, the score for documentation is 3 out of 5."
