The script follows the mathematical formulae for calculating the volume and surface area of a sphere, so it receives a full score in this category.\n\nCode Quality score is based on the readability, maintainability, and overall organization of the code. In this case, the script could be improved by assigning pi a constant value at the beginning or importing math module to use pi instead of reassigning it. Additionally, naming conventions for variables and functions could be more descriptive.\n\nUser Input Handling score is based on how well the script handles user input. In this case, there's no user input handling in the script as it directly calculates the volume and surface area of a sphere with a hardcoded radius value of 5.\n\nDocumentation score is based on the presence and quality of comments and documentation within the code. The script has some comments explaining what the function does, but there's no documentation about the input or output of the function.
