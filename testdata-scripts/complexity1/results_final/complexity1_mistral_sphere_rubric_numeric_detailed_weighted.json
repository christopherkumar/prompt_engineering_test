It meets all functional requirements. (9-10)\n\nLogic: The mathematical calculations for both the volume and surface area are accurate and logical. The script follows basic mathematical concepts correctly. (25-30)\n\nCode Quality: The code is well-structured, readable, and mostly adheres to PEP 8 standards. It includes a docstring explaining the function's purpose and its parameters. (19-24)\n\nUser Input Handling: The script handles user input with robust validation and error management. It checks for valid input (a positive number), and if an error occurs, it raises a ValueError with a descriptive message. (17-20)\n\nDocumentation: The script includes adequate documentation providing a general overview of the code functionality. It includes a docstring explaining the purpose of the function and its parameters. However, there is no documentation for individual functions or variables within the function. (5-6)"
