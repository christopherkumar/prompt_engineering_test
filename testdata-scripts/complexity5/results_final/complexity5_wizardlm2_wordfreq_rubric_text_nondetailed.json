The logic is also excellent, with clear and logical steps for processing the text and handling user input. The code quality is competent, with the use of regular expressions and the Counter class from the collections module, which are appropriate for the task. User input handling is excellent, as the script handles file not found exceptions and exits gracefully. Documentation is competent; the comments explain what each function does, but could be improved by providing more context or detail about the regular expression used."

User input handling is competent as it prompts for user input and handles a specific file not found error, but it could be improved by handling more types of exceptions that might arise from user input. Documentation is also competent as the script includes comments explaining the purpose of each function and the main part of the script, although it does not include extensive documentation beyond these comments."

The code quality is also high, with the use of a try-except block for robustness and the application of regular expressions to process text.
