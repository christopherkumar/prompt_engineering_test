However, there is no error handling for cases where the input file does not exist or cannot be read.\nLogic: The logic flow is good as it uses regular expressions to extract words from the text file and utilizes the Counter function from collections to count word occurrences.\nCode Quality: The code is well-structured, readable, and follows PEP 8 standards with proper indentation, naming conventions, and comments.\nUser Input Handling: The script handles user input by taking a file path as an argument and validates it using the open function. It also provides error handling for any exceptions that may occur during file reading.\nDocumentation: The script has adequate documentation with comments explaining the purpose of each function and what they do.
