It only handles one file input from the user and exits with an error message if the file is not found or an unexpected error occurs. (Score: 5)\n\nLogic: The logic of the task is implemented correctly by reading a file, extracting words, and counting their occurrences using regular expressions and Counter from collections module. (Score: 5)\n\nCode Quality: The code is well-structured with clear function definitions and proper use of try-except blocks for error handling. However, there are some issues such as missing indentation in the try block, inconsistent naming conventions, and unnecessary curly braces. (Score: 4)\n\nUser Input Handling: The script handles user input by asking for a file path and using that input to open the file. It also provides error messages when the file is not found or an unexpected error occurs. However, it only allows one file input and does not provide any options for handling multiple files or invalid inputs. (Score: 5)\n\nDocumentation: The script includes a brief comment at the beginning describing its purpose but lacks proper documentation for functions and variables. It also uses inconsistent naming conventions for variable names, which makes it difficult to understand their intended use. (Score: 3)"
