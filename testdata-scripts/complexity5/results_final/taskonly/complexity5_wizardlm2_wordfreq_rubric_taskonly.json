(Score: 4)\n- **User Input Handling**: The script handles user input by reading from a file named \"wordfreq_input.txt\". It does not handle unexpected input types or errors beyond a generic message for file open failure. (Score: 3)\n- **Documentation**: The script includes comments explaining the purpose of the script and some parts of the code, but there is no documentation on how to use the script or detailed explanations for the code logic.
