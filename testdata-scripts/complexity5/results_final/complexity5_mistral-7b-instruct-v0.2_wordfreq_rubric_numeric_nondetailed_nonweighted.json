It receives a functional score of 5.\n\nLogic: The logic used in the script is sound and effective. It uses regular expressions to extract words from the text file, and then uses a Counter object to keep track of word frequencies. It also handles errors robustly by using a try-except block. It receives a logical score of 5.\n\nCode Quality: The code is well-written and easy to read. It follows good coding practices such as using descriptive function names, adding comments where necessary, and handling exceptions appropriately. It receives a code quality score of 5.\n\nUser Input Handling: The script prompts the user for input and handles it correctly. It uses the input() function to get the file path from the user, and then passes this path to the parse\\_file\\_and\\_count\\_words() function. It also checks that the file exists before attempting to read it. It receives a user input handling score of 5.\n\nDocumentation: The script includes some documentation in the form of comments, but these could be more extensive and descriptive.
