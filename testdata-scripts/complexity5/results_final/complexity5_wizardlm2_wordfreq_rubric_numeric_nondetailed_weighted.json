        "raw_response": " Functionality: 8\nLogic: 25\nCode Quality: 17\nUser Input Handling: 10\nDocumentation: 4\n\n<Functionality score details> The script successfully reads the input file, counts the occurrences of each word, and prints the most frequent words in descending order. It handles punctuation by splitting on spaces, which is a common approach for simple text files without special characters or formatting. However, it does not handle case sensitivity (e.g., 'Word' and 'word' would be counted as different words). Additionally, it lacks features like ignoring stop words or handling different encodings.\n\n<Logic score details> The logic for reading the file, counting word occurrences, and sorting by frequency is correct. The script uses a dictionary to keep track of word counts and sorts the dictionary items by value in descending order before printing them.\n\n<Code Quality score details> The code is clean and follows Python naming conventions. It uses a context manager (`with` statement, implied by `open`) for file operations, which is good practice. However, it lacks error handling (e.g., what if the file does not exist?) and does not use any advanced data structures or algorithms that could improve efficiency or readability. The code also has a minor issue: it would be more Pythonic to use `sys.argv` for command-line argument handling instead of hardcoding the filename within the function.\n\n<User Input Handling score details> The script handles user input (the text file) by reading its contents and processing them accordingly. It assumes that the file is in the correct format (plain text, with words separated by spaces). There is no validation or error handling for the input file's content or format.\n\n<Documentation score details> The script includes a docstring at the function level, which explains the purpose of the `count_words` function. However, there is no additional documentation such as comments within the code to explain complex logic or to describe the expected input/output behavior in detail. The docstring could be more comprehensive by including information about the file format expected and any limitations or special considerations."

It meets the assignment requirements. Deducted one point for not handling punctuation or case sensitivity beyond lowercasing.\n- Logic: The logic is sound with proper use of `Counter` to count word frequencies and error handling for file not found. Deducted three points for not considering all possible user input errors (e.g., empty file, permission issues).\n- Code Quality: The code is clean and follows Python conventions. However, deducted five points for the use of `exit(1)` which is not the best practice for handling errors in a script that should terminate gracefully or log the error instead of exiting abruptly.\n- User Input Handling: The script handles user input by prompting for a file path and processing it. Deducted one point for not validating the content of the input beyond checking if the file exists.\n- Documentation: The script includes a docstring for each function, which is good. However, the main description could be more detailed about what constitutes \"advanced error checks\" and how the output is considered \"clean.\" Deducted four points for lack of comprehensive documentation on the entire process, including handling of different word types (e.g., single words, compound words).\n<End of Evaluation>"
