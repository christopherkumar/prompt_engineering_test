For example, the `tally_words` function does not handle words that appear in the input file as a single word, such as \"the\". Additionally, the `display_word_tally` function does not properly sort the output, listing the most frequent words first instead of in descending order.\n\nLogic: 4/5\nThe script has good logical structure and implementation for counting the frequency of each word in the input file. However, there are some minor issues with efficiency and accuracy. For example, the `tally_words` function uses a list comprehension to count the frequency of each word, which can be slow for large input files. Additionally, the script does not handle misspelled words or words that are not in the dictionary.\n\nCode Quality: 4/5\nThe code is well-structured and readable, but there are some minor issues with PEP 8 compliance. For example, the `read_file_contents` function does not use a context manager to close the file after reading it, which can lead to unnecessary file closures. Additionally, the `display_word_tally` function does not use a consistent indentation level throughout the code.\n\nUser Input Handling: 4/5\nThe script has good input handling and validation, but there are some minor issues with error management. For example, if the user enters an invalid input, such as a word that is not in the dictionary, the script does not provide any feedback or error messages. Additionally, the `read_file_contents` function does not handle files that do not exist.\n\nDocumentation: 3/5\nThe script has some documentation, but it is minimal and does not provide a comprehensive overview of the program functionality. For example, the `tally_words` function does not have any comments explaining its purpose or how it works. Additionally, the `display_word_tally` function does not have any comments explaining why it sorts the output in descending order instead of in ascending order.\n\nOverall, the script receives a score of 3.5/5 for functionality, 4/5 for logic, 4/5 for code quality, 4/5 for user input handling, and 3/5 for documentation."

However, there are some areas where the code could be improved, such as using a more efficient regular expression for word matching (see Logic section below). Additionally, the script does not follow PEP 8 standards consistently throughout (see Code Quality section below).\n\nUser Input Handling: 3/5\nThe script has some issues with user input handling. For example, it does not perform any validation on the input file path before attempting to open it, which could lead to errors if the user enters an invalid path. Additionally, the script does not handle unexpected input well, such as if the input file contains no words or contains only one word (see User Input Handling section below).\n\nDocumentation: 4/5\nThe script has adequate documentation, including comments and docstrings. However, there are some areas where the documentation could be improved, such as providing more detail on the regular expression used for word matching (see Code Quality section below).\n\nOverall, the script receives a score of 3.8/5. While it functions correctly and produces the expected output, there are some areas where it could be improved in terms of logic, code quality, user input handling, and documentation."
