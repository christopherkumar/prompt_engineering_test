The logic is sound, with efficient use of regular expressions for word extraction and Counter from collections for frequency counting. The code quality is excellent, following PEP 8 standards and using try-except blocks for error handling. User input handling is adequate, but could be improved by adding more specific error messages or input validation beyond the basic FileNotFoundError check. Documentation is present but not extensive, providing brief explanations of functions but lacking detailed comments throughout the code."
