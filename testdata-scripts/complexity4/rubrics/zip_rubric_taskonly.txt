In this assignment a Python script was to be developed which creates subroutine that zips every folder from an input directory into a separate output directory.
The files in directory "D:/pretendfolder/pretenddata" need to be zipped to the directory "D:/pretendfolder/pretendzippeddata"

Areas for consideration are:
-whether the script compiles or not
-how well the logic of the task is implemented
-the quality of the code written
-does the script handle user input? how well?
-how well is the code documented/commented
