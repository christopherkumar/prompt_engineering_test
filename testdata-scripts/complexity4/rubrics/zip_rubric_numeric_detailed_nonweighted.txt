In this assignment a Python script was to be developed which creates subroutine that zips every folder from an input directory into a separate output directory.
The files in directory "D:/pretendfolder/pretenddata" need to be zipped to the directory "D:/pretendfolder/pretendzippeddata"

Rubric:
Functionality
- 1: Contains major issues.
- 2: Has one minor issue but nearly functions correctly.
- 3: Compiles and runs with some poorly written sections.
- 4: Functions well with minimal issues.
- 5: Almost flawless in performance.
Logic
- 1: Minimal logic implementation; numerous errors and inefficiencies. Fails to correctly zip folders.
- 2: Basic logical structures with some errors; zips folders with minor inaccuracies.
- 3: Adequate logic flow and correct application for zipping folders; occasional errors or inefficiencies.
- 4: Good logical structure and accurate zipping process; minor inefficiencies.
- 5: Excellent logical coherence, efficient and accurate zipping of all folders.
Code Quality
- 1: Poorly structured and non-idiomatic code; frequent violations of PEP 8 standards.
- 2: Basic structure with some adherence to PEP 8; moderate readability issues.
- 3: Adequately structured code with minor PEP 8 inconsistencies; readable.
- 4: Well-structured, readable code mostly adhering to PEP 8; minor style issues.
- 5: Exceptionally well-structured, highly readable, and fully PEP 8 compliant code.
User Input Handling
- 1: Minimal input validation; frequent errors and crashes on unexpected input.
- 2: Basic input handling with some validation; occasional errors on unexpected input.
- 3: Adequate handling and validation of user input; infrequent errors.
- 4: Good input handling with robust validation and error management.
- 5: Excellent, user-friendly input handling with comprehensive validation and error prevention.
Documentation
- 1: Minimal or no documentation; many sections of code are undocumented.
- 2: Basic documentation covering some parts of the code; lacks detail.
- 3: Adequate documentation providing a general overview of code
functionality.
- 4: Good documentation with detailed explanations of most code sections.
- 5: Exceptional documentation throughout with thorough explanations
and examples.
