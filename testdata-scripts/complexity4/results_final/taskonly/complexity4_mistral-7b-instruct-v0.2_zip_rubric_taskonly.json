The logic of the task is well implemented, as the script correctly identifies directories using os.scandir() and walks through their contents using os.walk(). The code quality is good, with clear variable names, proper indentation, and appropriate use of functions and modules. User input handling is also handled effectively, as the script takes two command-line arguments for the source and destination directories. Lastly, the code is well documented with a clear function description and an informative comment at the beginning of the file."
