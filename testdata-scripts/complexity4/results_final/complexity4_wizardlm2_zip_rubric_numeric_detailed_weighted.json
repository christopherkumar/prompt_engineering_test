It correctly zips each folder from the input directory into a separate zip file in the output directory. The assertion at the beginning ensures that the input is indeed a directory, which is a good practice for input validation. The use of `os.makedirs` with `exist_ok=True` handles potential issues with existing directories gracefully. The script also includes a print statement to confirm successful zipping, which is user-friendly and helps with debugging.\n\nThe logic for zipping the folders is efficient and accurate, with no apparent errors in the zipping process. The code structure is mostly adhering to PEP 8 standards, with minor style issues such as missing spaces around operators in some cases.\n\nInput handling and validation are robust, as the script includes an assertion to check if the input directory exists before proceeding. There are no explicit error checks for unexpected input types beyond this assertion, but the script is designed to handle directories and should not crash on unexpected input such as files or non-existent paths.\n\nThe documentation provides a general overview of the `zip_directories` function's purpose and behavior, which is adequate. However, it could be improved with more detailed explanations for some parts of the code, such as the handling of relative paths within the zip file."
