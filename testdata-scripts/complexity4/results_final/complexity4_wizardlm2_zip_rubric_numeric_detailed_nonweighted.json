It handles subdirectories within the folders as well. The logic for zipping is accurate, with minor inefficiencies such as opening a new zip file for each file instead of adding all files from a folder to a single zip file before closing it, which could be more efficient.\n\nThe code quality is high, following PEP 8 standards and being well-structured. The use of 'for' loops and the handling of paths are done correctly. There are minor style issues, such as the lack of spaces around operators in some instances (e.g., `zipf.write(os.path.join(root, file))` could be written as `zipf.write(os.path.join(root, file))`).\n\nUser input handling is adequate; the script does not validate the existence of the input and output directories beyond checking if they are strings. It assumes that the paths provided are valid and accessible, which may lead to errors if they are not.\n\nDocumentation provides a general overview of the code functionality but lacks detailed explanations for most sections. There is no explanation of the `zip_files` function or the handling of zip file creation and closure within it. There are also no comments explaining the purpose of variables or the logic behind certain decisions in the code."
