The script uses recursion effectively to traverse through all the directories and files within them, zipping each one into a separate zip file.\nCode Quality: Competent, Adequately structured code with minor PEP 8 inconsistencies; readable. The script follows a logical flow and is easy to understand, but there are some minor issues such as missing whitespaces and indentation inconsistencies.\nUser Input Handling: OK, Basic input handling with some validation; occasional errors on unexpected input. The script takes two arguments, source directory and destination directory, which are validated using os.path.exists() before proceeding with the zipping process. However, there is no error handling for cases where a specific directory cannot be zipped due to permission issues or other errors.\nDocumentation: Competent, Adequate documentation providing a general overview of code functionality. The script has a docstring that describes the function and its arguments, but it could benefit from more detailed comments explaining each step of the process."
