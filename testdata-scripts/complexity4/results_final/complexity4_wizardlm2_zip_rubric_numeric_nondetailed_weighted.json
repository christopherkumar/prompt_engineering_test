The code follows PEP 8 guidelines and uses 'exist_ok=True' for robustness.\n- User Input Handling is good as the script takes two command-line arguments for input and output directories. However, it lacks validation for the existence of the input directory beyond a simple raise statement, which might not be informative enough if the script is run with incorrect permissions or in an environment where 'D:/pretendfolder/pretenddata' does not exist due to other reasons than it not being created.\n- Documentation is clear and provides a brief description of the function's purpose, parameters, and a basic example of its usage. However, there could be additional comments within the code to explain complex logic or decisions made during the coding process.\n<End of Evaluation>"
