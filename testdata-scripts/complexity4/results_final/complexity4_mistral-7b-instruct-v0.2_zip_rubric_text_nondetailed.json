It handles cases where the source and destination directories do not exist and creates the destination directory if it does not already exist. (Excellent)\n\nLogic: The script follows a logical flow by first checking if the source directory exists, then creating the destination directory if it does not exist, and finally zipping each directory in the source directory. (Perfect)\n\nCode Quality: The code is readable and follows Python's coding conventions, but there are some areas that could be improved for better organization and maintainability. For example, the function name \"efficient_directory_zip\" could be more descriptive, and the print statement in case of a non-existent source directory could be replaced with a more informative error message. (Competent)\n\nUser Input Handling: The script handles user input correctly by using absolute paths for the source and destination directories to ensure that the correct directories are zipped. It also checks if the source directory exists before attempting to zip it. (Excellent)\n\nDocumentation: The script lacks documentation, such as comments explaining what each part of the code does or why certain decisions were made. This makes it difficult for others to understand and maintain the code. (Poor)"
