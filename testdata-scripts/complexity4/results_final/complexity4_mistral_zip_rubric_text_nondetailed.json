It handles cases where the source and destination folders exist and processes all directories within the source folder. This meets the functionality requirement as stated in the problem description.\n\nLogic: The script follows a logical flow, starting by checking if the source folder exists and creating the destination folder if it doesn't. Then, it iterates through each directory in the source folder, zips the files within that directory into a separate zip file with the same name as the directory.\n\nCode Quality: The code is well-structured and easy to read. It uses appropriate variable names, functions are defined with clear documentation, and error handling is implemented using exceptions.\n\nUser Input Handling: The script handles user input by accepting two string arguments representing the source and destination folders. However, it does not provide any mechanism for the user to check or modify these inputs before they are used in the script. This could be improved by adding some form of user interaction or validation.\n\nDocumentation: While the code is well-structured and easy to read, there is no documentation provided for the script as a whole or for individual functions. This makes it difficult for others to understand the purpose and functionality of the script without reading through the code itself."
