It can add, delete, update, and list contacts. The logic is perfect as all functions are defined correctly and work as intended. The code quality is excellent due to the use of classes, proper indentation, and clear variable names. User input handling is competent since it uses user input in the main function for adding a contact but could be improved by making the script more interactive. Documentation is good with clear comments describing each class and function."

It allows users to add, delete, update, and search for contacts. The logic of the script is also sound, with clear and concise implementation of classes and methods. The code quality could be improved by adding error handling for edge cases and using more descriptive variable names. User input handling is excellent as it uses built-in functions to check for contact existence before performing any operation.
