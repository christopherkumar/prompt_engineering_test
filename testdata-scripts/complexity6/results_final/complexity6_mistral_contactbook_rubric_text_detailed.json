        "raw_response": " Functionality: Competent, Logic: Excellent, Code Quality: Competent, User Input Handling: Competent, Documentation: OK\n\nThis Python script implements a simple contact book application with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and search functionality. The script is able to load and save contacts from/to a JSON file, ensuring no duplicate contacts are added. Overall, the script functions well with some minor issues such as lack of error handling for file I/O operations and missing input validation in some places.\n\nLogic: Excellent - The script has a good logical structure and accurate implementation for contact management. It uses classes to represent contacts and a contact book, which is a common design pattern for this type of application. The operations are well-defined and easy to understand.\n\nCode Quality: Competent - The code is adequately structured with minor PEP 8 inconsistencies. It is readable but could benefit from better naming conventions and more consistent indentation.\n\nUser Input Handling: Competent - User input is handled through function arguments, which is a common way to handle user input in Python scripts. However, there is no input validation or error handling for unexpected input.\n\nDocumentation: OK - The script has basic documentation covering some parts of the code, but it lacks detail and could benefit from more comprehensive documentation."
