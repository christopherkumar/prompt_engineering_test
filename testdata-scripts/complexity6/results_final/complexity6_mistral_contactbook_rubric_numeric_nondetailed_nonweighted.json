(Score: 5)\n\nCode Quality: The code is well-structured, easy to read, and maintainable. However, there are a few areas that could be improved for better code quality such as using functions instead of methods with long code blocks, adding error handling, and separating the user interface logic from the data handling logic. (Score: 4)\n\nUser Input Handling: The script effectively handles user input by taking appropriate actions based on the commands entered by the user. It also provides clear feedback to the user about the success or failure of their actions. (Score: 5)\n\nDocumentation: While the code is well-written and easy to understand, there is a lack of proper documentation for the script as a whole and its individual components. Adding comments and docstrings would improve the readability and maintainability of the code. (Score: 3)"
