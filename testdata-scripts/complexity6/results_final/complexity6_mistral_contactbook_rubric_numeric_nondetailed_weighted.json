The score is set to 10.\n\nUser Input Handling: The script does not handle user input directly. Instead, it relies on a hardcoded name for the search operation. Therefore, the User Input Handling score is set to 5.\n\nDocumentation: The script has minimal documentation in the form of comments. While the comments are descriptive and helpful, they do not cover all aspects of the code. Therefore, the Documentation score is set to 3.\n\n<end of response>"

It allows users to add, delete, update, and search for contacts through the command line interface. (Score: 10)\n\nLogic: The script follows a logical flow of creating a Contact class, a ContactBook class, and implementing methods for adding, deleting, listing contacts, and handling user input in the ContactBook class. (Score: 30)\n\nCode Quality: The code is well-structured with clear variable names, indentation, and separation of concerns between classes. However, there are some minor improvements that could be made such as using a dictionary instead of a list for storing contacts to improve lookup time. (Score: 25)\n\nUser Input Handling: The script effectively handles user input by taking commands from the user and performing the corresponding actions based on those commands. However, there is no error handling in place for invalid inputs or edge cases. (Score: 20)\n\nDocumentation: The script includes some basic documentation in the form of comments describing the purpose of the classes and methods. However, more comprehensive documentation explaining each function's arguments and return values would be beneficial. (Score: 8)\n\n<end of response>"
