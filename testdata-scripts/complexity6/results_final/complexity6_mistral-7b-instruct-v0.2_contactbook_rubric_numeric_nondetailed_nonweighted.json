The logic is sound with proper error handling and file-based data persistence. The code quality is high due to the use of classes, clear naming conventions, and separation of concerns. User input handling is not explicitly shown in the script but can be assumed to be handled through function arguments. Documentation could be improved by adding comments for each function explaining their purpose and expected inputs/outputs."
