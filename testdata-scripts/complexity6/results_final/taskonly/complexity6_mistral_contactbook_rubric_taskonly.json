It implements all required features for the contact book application - add, delete, update, search, and list contacts. (5)\n\nLogic: The logic is well-implemented using object-oriented programming principles. Each Contact is an instance of a Contact class, and the ContactBook manages a collection of Contacts. The methods are appropriately named and perform their intended functions. (5)\n\nCode Quality: The code is clean and easy to read. It follows good coding practices such as using meaningful variable names, indentation, and proper use of classes and methods. (5)\n\nUser Input Handling: The script handles user input by accepting name and number inputs for adding or updating contacts. However, it could be improved by providing more options for user interaction, such as a menu for selecting actions. (4)\n\nDocumentation: The code is well-documented with clear comments explaining the purpose of each class, method, and variable. It also includes a brief description at the beginning of the script.
