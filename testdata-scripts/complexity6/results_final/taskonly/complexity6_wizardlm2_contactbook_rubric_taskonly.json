Therefore, it fails to meet the functionality criteria. The logic is also not implemented due to the lack of actual functionality within these functions. The code quality is scored higher because the functions are defined with clear intentions, although they do not perform any action. User input handling cannot be assessed as there is no interaction with the user beyond the function calls which themselves do not handle input. Lastly, the script includes some documentation in the form of comments explaining the purpose of each function, hence a higher score for documentation."
