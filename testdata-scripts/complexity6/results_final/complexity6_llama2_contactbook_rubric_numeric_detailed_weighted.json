However, there are some minor issues with the functionality, such as the lack of error handling in the `add_contact` function when the name or number is not provided.\n\nLogic: 14/18\nThe script has good logical structure and implementation for contact management. The `list_contacts` function properly iterates over the contacts dictionary and prints the name and number of each contact. However, there are some minor inefficiencies in the code, such as using `items()` instead of `keys()` to iterate over the dictionary.\n\nCode Quality: 16/20\nThe script has some areas where the code could be improved for readability and maintainability. For example, the use of `contacts` as a variable name is not very descriptive, and the lack of whitespace between statements makes the code harder to read. However, the script does follow some basic PEP 8 standards, such as using lowercase names and proper indentation.\n\nUser Input Handling: 12/16\nThe script has good input handling and validation in the `list_contacts` function. It properly handles unexpected input and provides appropriate error messages. However, there is room for improvement in the `add_contact` function, as it does not validate that the name or number are provided before adding them to the contacts dictionary.\n\nDocumentation: 10/10\nThe script has excellent documentation throughout, with thorough explanations and examples. The functions are well-documented, and the code is organized in a logical manner.\n\nOverall score: 74/100"

The `add_contact()` function works correctly and adds new contacts to the list. The `show_contacts()` function displays all the contacts in the list. However, there are some areas where the script could be improved:\n\nFunctionality:\nThe script functions as intended, but it does not handle edge cases well. For example, if the user enters an invalid input (e.g., a name that is too long or a number that is not a valid phone number), the script will crash. To improve the functionality score, the script could include error handling and validation to prevent crashes.\n\nLogic:\nThe script has some minor errors in the logic. For example, the `add_contact()` function does not check if the contact list is empty before adding a new contact. This can lead to an infinite loop if the user keeps adding contacts without removing any existing ones. To improve the logic score, the script could include more robust error handling and validation.\n\nCode Quality:\nThe code quality is good overall, but there are some areas where it could be improved. For example, the `add_contact()` function uses a list comprehension to create a new contact dictionary, which can make the code harder to read. To improve the code quality score, the script could use a more readable and maintainable approach to creating the contact dictionaries.\n\nUser Input Handling:\nThe script handles user input well, but it does not validate the input adequately. For example, the `add_contact()` function does not check if the input name or number is valid before adding it to the list. To improve the user input handling score, the script could include more robust validation and error handling.\n\nDocumentation:\nThe script has some documentation, but it could be improved. For example, the `add_contact()` function does not provide enough detail about what the function does or how it works.
