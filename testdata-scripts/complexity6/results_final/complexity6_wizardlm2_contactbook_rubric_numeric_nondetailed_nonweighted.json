The logic flow within each function is correct in that they print a message indicating their purpose, but no further action is taken.\n\nThe code quality is somewhat higher due to the use of functions to encapsulate different operations, which is a good practice.

It scores high but is docked points because the functionality is limited to only one type of operation and does not include add, update, or search functionalities as specified in the assignment description.\n- **Logic**: The logic for deleting a contact is correct. If the name exists in the dictionary, it is deleted, and a message is printed. If the name does not exist, an appropriate message is printed.\n- **Code Quality**: The code is readable and follows Python naming conventions. However, it lacks comments or docstrings, which would improve documentation for other developers. Additionally, the script only handles one type of operation, which affects its robustness.\n- **User Input Handling**: The script hardcodes the input ('Jane Doe') instead of handling user input dynamically. It should prompt the user to enter a name and handle different types of input (e.g., 'jane doe', 'JaneDoe', etc.).\n- **Documentation**: There is no documentation provided, such as a docstring explaining what the function does or how to use the script.
