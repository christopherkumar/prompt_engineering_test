However, for small datasets, this is a minor concern.\n\nLogic: 25-30\nThe logical structure for managing contacts is well thought out and implemented correctly with minimal errors or inefficiencies.

It uses classes and methods appropriately to represent the contact book and its operations.\n\nUser Input Handling: 17-20\nThe script handles user input with robust validation and error management.
