Similarly, the `update_contact` method does not handle the case where the contact is not found, and it should either raise an exception or provide a more informative error message.\n\nLogic: 4 (Good logical structure and accurate implementation)\n\nThe script has good logical structure and implements the contact book functionality correctly. However, there are some minor issues with the implementation that prevent it from achieving a perfect score. For example, the `find_contact` method does not handle the case where the contact is not found, and it should either raise an exception or provide a more informative error message. Similarly, the `delete_contact` method does not check if the contact is actually deleted before saving the changes, which could result in data loss.\n\nCode Quality: 4 (Well-structured, readable code with minor style issues)\n\nThe script has good structure and readability, but there are some minor style issues that prevent it from achieving a perfect score. For example, the `Contact` class has a redundant `name` attribute, and the `ContactBook` class uses `json.load()` instead of `json.loads()` to parse the JSON data. Additionally, the `find_contact` method could benefit from using a more efficient algorithm for searching the contacts.\n\nUser Input Handling: 4 (Good input handling with robust validation and error management)\n\nThe script has good input handling and robust validation and error management. However, there are some minor issues with the implementation that prevent it from achieving a perfect score. For example, the `add_contact` method does not check if the phone number is valid before saving it, which could result in data loss. Similarly, the `update_contact` method does not check if the contact is actually updated before saving the changes, which could result in data loss.\n\nOverall, the script has good functionality and logical structure, but there are some minor issues with the implementation that prevent it from achieving a perfect score."
