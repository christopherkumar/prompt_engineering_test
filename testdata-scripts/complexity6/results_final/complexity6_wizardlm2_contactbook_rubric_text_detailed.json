It also includes exception handling for cases where a contact already exists or is not found during deletion. There is no implementation for updating or searching for a specific contact, which would bring it down from 'Excellent' to 'Competent'.\n\nLogic: Excellent\nThe logical structure for managing contacts is well-implemented with clear separation of concerns and appropriate use of classes and methods. The exception handling adds to the robustness of the application logic.\n\nCode Quality: Competent\nThe code is structured into classes and methods, which is good practice. It follows some PEP 8 standards, but there are inconsistencies, such as missing type annotations and indentation that may not adhere to the standard. The code is generally readable.\n\nUser Input Handling: Competent\nThe script includes basic input handling with some validation in the `add_contact` and `remove_contact` methods. It raises exceptions when encountering invalid operations, which is a good practice for error management. However, there is no comprehensive input handling for updating or searching contacts.\n\nDocumentation: Excellent\nThe script includes docstrings for classes and methods, providing a clear description of their functionality.
