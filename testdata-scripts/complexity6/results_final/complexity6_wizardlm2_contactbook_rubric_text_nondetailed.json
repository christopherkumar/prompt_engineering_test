The function `search_contact` takes a name as input and checks if that name exists in the dictionary, then prints the appropriate message.\n\n<Code Quality> The code quality is poor because it lacks proper structure (e.g., no main loop or user interaction), uses a global variable (`contacts`) which is not ideal for larger applications, and has redundant code (the `search_contact` function is called at the end of the script without being used).\n\n<User Input Handling> The script can handle user input in the form of a contact name to search for. It does so competently by checking if the name exists within the contacts dictionary and providing feedback accordingly. However, it does not handle multiple inputs or different types of user commands (add, delete, update).\n\n<Documentation> The documentation is poor as there are no comments explaining what the script does, how to use it, or any documentation on the functions provided.

However, there are some redundant checks (e.g., checking for empty name or number in `add_contact` when a contact with the same name already exists). Additionally, using a list of dictionaries to store contacts may not be the most efficient approach for larger datasets.
