The functionality is complete, but there seems to be no error handling for cases where the user input is not in the expected format (e.g., when adding or updating a contact). This could be considered a limitation, but it does not affect the overall competency of the script's functionality.\n\nThe logic of the script is excellent as it follows a clear design pattern with well-defined classes and methods. The naming conventions are consistent, and the flow of control is logical.\n\nThe code quality is perfect as the script adheres to best practices such as using docstrings for functions and classes, following PEP8 style guidelines, and handling exceptions appropriately.\n\nUser input handling is competent since the script uses the built-in `next()` function to search for a contact by name, but it does not provide any error handling or validation for user input when adding or updating contacts.\n\nThe documentation is excellent as the script includes docstrings for functions and classes, making it easy to understand their purpose and usage. Additionally, the script's name and comments are descriptive and clear."
