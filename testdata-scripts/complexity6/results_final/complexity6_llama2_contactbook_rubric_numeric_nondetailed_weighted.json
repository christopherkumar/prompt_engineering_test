However, it is missing implementation details for these features, which reduces its functionality score. Score: 5/10\n\nLogic: The script's logic is simple and straightforward, but it is lacking in terms of complexity and sophistication. It does not handle edge cases or provide any advanced features. Score: 10/30\n\nCode Quality: The code quality is average, with some minor issues such as missing docstrings and inconsistent indentation. However, there are no major issues that would significantly impact the script's performance. Score: 20/30\n\nUser Input Handling: The script does not handle user input well, as it does not provide any mechanism for users to input or edit contact information. This reduces its score in this category. Score: 10/20\n\nDocumentation: The script has minimal documentation, with only a few print statements that provide basic information about the script's functionality. This reduces its score in this category. Score: 5/10\n\nOverall, the script has some room for improvement in terms of functionality, logic, code quality, user input handling, and documentation."

It takes in two arguments `name` and `number`, appends them to a list `contacts`, and then returns the updated list. For this reason, I have given it a score of 20 out of 30 for logic.\n\nCode Quality: The script is well-structured and easy to read, with proper indentation and spacing. However, it does not include any comments or documentation, which deducts from its overall score. I have given it a score of 25 out of 30 for code quality.\n\nUser Input Handling: The script handles user input correctly by taking in the `name` and `number` arguments and appending them to the list `contacts`. However, it does not include any validation or error handling, which deducts from its overall score.

The logic score is 20 out of 30, as there are no errors or issues with the script's logic.\n\nCode Quality: The script has some good practices in terms of code organization and indentation. However, it could benefit from additional comments to explain the purpose of each function and why certain variables are defined the way they are. The code quality score is 15 out of 30.\n\nUser Input Handling: The script handles user input correctly by prompting the user for a new number when the 'update' function is called.

However, it only has one function (add_contact) and one function (list_contacts) which limits its functionality. Therefore, I have scored it an 8 out of 10 for Functionality.\n\nLogic: The script's logic is straightforward and easy to follow. It uses a dictionary to store the contact information and provides clear and concise output when searching or listing the contacts. For this reason, I have scored it a 20 out of 30 for Logic.\n\nCode Quality: The script has good organization and structure, with each function serving a distinct purpose. However, there are some minor issues with indentation and spacing that could be improved. Therefore, I have scored it a 25 out of 30 for Code Quality.\n\nUser Input Handling: The script handles user input correctly by taking in the name and number as arguments and storing them in the dictionary. However, there is no error handling or validation for invalid input. For this reason, I have scored it a 15 out of 20 for User Input Handling.\n\nDocumentation: The script does not provide any documentation or comments to explain its functionality or usage. Therefore, I have scored it an 8 out of 10 for Documentation.\n\nOverall, the script has some room for improvement in terms of functionality and code quality, but it meets the basic requirements of the assignment."

The `update_contact()` function takes two arguments, `name` and `new_number`, and updates the corresponding entry in the `contacts` dictionary if the name exists in the dictionary. The script also includes some checks to handle invalid input, such as printing \"Contact not found\" if the name is not found in the dictionary.\n\nThe logic of the script is simple and easy to follow, with a clear separation of concerns between the `update_contact()` function and the main code that prints the updated contacts dictionary. The code quality is good, with proper indentation and consistent naming conventions. However, there are some minor issues with formatting and spacing that could be improved.\n\nThe user input handling is adequate, as the script handles invalid input by printing a clear message. However, it would be better to handle edge cases such as empty strings or non-numeric numbers. Finally, the documentation is minimal but sufficient for this simple application.\n</end of response>"

However, there are some minor issues with the way the code is structured, such as the use of global variables and the lack of error handling for invalid user input.\n\nCode Quality: 20/30\nThe script's code quality is average. There are some areas where the code could be improved, such as using a more consistent naming convention and adding comments to explain the purpose of each function. Additionally, the use of global variables can make the code harder to maintain and debug.\n\nUser Input Handling: 15/20\nThe script handles user input well, with clear and concise prompts for the user to enter contact information.

However, it does not include any advanced features such as searching by multiple fields or integrating with other apps. Therefore, the score is 8 out of 10.\n\nLogic: The script has some logical errors in the implementation of the `add_contact`, `update_contact`, and `delete_contact` methods. For example, the `add_contact` method does not check if the contact already exists before adding it to the list, which can lead to duplicate contacts. Similarly, the `update_contact` method does not validate that the contact being updated exists before updating its details. The `delete_contact` method also does not validate that the contact being deleted actually exists. These errors reduce the score for logic to 25 out of 30.\n\nCode Quality: The script has some code quality issues, such as using `try-except` blocks without proper error handling and lacking docstrings for functions and classes. However, it does use consistent indentation and follows a logical structure. Therefore, the score is 20 out of 30.\n\nUser Input Handling: The script handles user input correctly by validating the input before adding or updating contacts. However, it does not provide any feedback to the user if an invalid input is provided. Therefore, the score is 15 out of 20.\n\nDocumentation: The script has minimal documentation, only providing a brief description of the classes and functions. However, it does include docstrings for each function and class, which helps to some extent. Therefore, the score is 9 out of 10."
