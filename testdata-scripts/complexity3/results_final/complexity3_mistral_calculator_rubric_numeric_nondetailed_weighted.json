However, it lacks the ability to handle multiplication and division which are also mentioned in the problem statement. Therefore, a score of 8 is assigned.\n\nLogic: The logic part of the script is not applicable as there is no conditional or looping statement present in the code.\n\nCode Quality: The code quality is poor due to the following reasons:\n1. Function names are not written in lowercase and separated by underscores as per PEP8 guidelines.\n2. There is a missing colon (:) at the end of the function definitions.\n3. The script does not handle input validation or error checking.\n4. The subtraction function is defined incorrectly, it should take two arguments instead of one.\n5. The script prints the result of addition and subtraction operations directly without any user interaction.\n\nUser Input Handling: The script does not handle user input at all as it directly performs the arithmetic operations on hardcoded values. Therefore, a score of 0 is assigned.\n\nDocumentation: The script has some documentation in the form of comments explaining what the calculator program is and what functions it contains. However, there is no documentation for the individual functions or their parameters. Therefore, a score of 5 is assigned.\n<end of response>"
