However, there is no error handling or edge cases considered, which brings down the score to Competent.\n\nCode Quality: Excellent\nThe code is well-structured, readable, and follows a consistent naming convention. It also uses appropriate indentation and comments, resulting in an Excellent score for code quality.\n\nUser Input Handling: Excellent\nThe script handles user input correctly, and the output is accurate and relevant to the input provided. The score remains Excellent.\n\nDocumentation: OK\nWhile the script does not have extensive documentation, it does include a brief explanation of each function. However, there is no additional information or context provided, which results in a score of OK for documentation.\n\nTherefore, the overall score for this Python script is:\n\nFunctionality: OK (2) + Logic: Competent (3) + Code Quality: Excellent (4) + User Input Handling: Excellent (4) + Documentation: OK (2) = 15/6 = 2.5\n\nNote that the scores are based on the rubric provided and the assessment of the script against those criteria."
