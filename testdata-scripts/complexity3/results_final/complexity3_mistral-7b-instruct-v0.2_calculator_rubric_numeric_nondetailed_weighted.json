The indentation is also correct, making it easy to read and understand.\n\nUser Input Handling: Since the script does not handle user input in this provided version, it scores zero in this category.\n\nDocumentation: The documentation is present for each function, providing a brief description of what the function does. This makes it easier for others to understand the code. However, there is no documentation for the main part of the script where the calculations are performed. Therefore, it scores 10 out of 10 in this category."
