However, the Logic criterion receives a Poor score due to the following reasons:\n\n1. The function definitions do not follow Python syntax. In Python, functions should be defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses. For example, it should be `def add(x, y)` instead of `def add(x, y)`.\n2. The subtraction function does not handle string input correctly. It tries to perform subtraction on a string and an integer, which is not valid in Python.\n\nThe Code Quality criterion also receives a Poor score due to the following reasons:\n\n1. The functions are defined without proper indentation, making it hard to read and understand the code.\n2. There is no error handling or input validation, which can lead to unexpected behavior if invalid inputs are provided.\n3.

It correctly performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input. The logic is sound, with clear and concise function definitions and proper use of exceptions for error handling. The code quality could be improved by adding comments and better naming conventions for variables and functions. User input handling is excellent as it validates and converts user input to the appropriate data types before performing calculations. Documentation is good but could benefit from more detailed comments explaining each function's purpose and how they interact with one another."

It also ensures robust error handling and input validation through the use of try-except blocks and the get\\_operation() function. The functionality is excellent as it meets all the requirements specified in the problem statement.\n\nThe logic is perfect as the script correctly implements the required arithmetic operations using functions for each operation.\n\nThe code quality is competent, as there are no major issues with the code structure and readability, but there could be some improvements in terms of naming conventions and indentation.\n\nUser input handling is excellent as it uses proper error messages and prompts the user to enter valid inputs. It also handles division by zero errors gracefully.\n\nDocumentation is good as it provides a brief description of the script, but could be improved by adding more detailed comments for each function and variable."
