However, the subtraction function is not operational due to incorrect parameter types (string instead of integer). The division and multiplication operations are missing. The functionality is limited but partially meets the requirements by providing only two out of four expected operations.\n\n<Logic explanation> The logic score is low because the script attempts to perform a subtraction operation with incorrect data types, which will result in an error. The correct handling of user input and type checking are not present.\n\n<Code Quality explanation> The code quality is moderate; it follows basic Python syntax and function definition. However, the code lacks comments, proper indentation (the `subtract` function is missing a colon after its header), and does not handle exceptions that may arise from incorrect user input types.\n\n<User Input Handling explanation> The script does not handle user input beyond hardcoded values. It also fails to validate the data types of the inputs, which would be necessary for a fully functional calculator.\n\n<Documentation explanation> The script includes a docstring at the top explaining the purpose of the program. However, each function lacks its own docstring explaining what it does, its parameters, and its return value. The documentation is minimal but meets the requirement for a basic description."

The script does not handle user input, instead, it uses hardcoded values. Therefore, it partially meets the requirements.\n\n<Logic explanation> The logic for addition and multiplication is correct.

The use of comments is appropriate. The code follows Python naming conventions and syntax rules.\n\n<User Input Handling explanation> The script does not handle user input; it uses hardcoded values.

It also handles invalid inputs and division by zero errors gracefully.\nLogic is scored at 28 because the script correctly implements the four arithmetic operations, includes error handling for division by zero, and uses a dictionary to map operations to functions. The logic is sound and follows the requirements.\nCode Quality is scored at 25 as the code is well-structured with clear function definitions, meaningful function names, and proper exception handling. The use of a dictionary for operations is efficient and the code is easy to read and understand.\nUser Input Handling is scored at 16 because while the script handles user input correctly, it could be improved by providing a clearer message when an invalid operation is entered, rather than repeating the prompt. Additionally, the script does not handle cases where the user enters something other than a number or an operation symbol.\nDocumentation is awarded 9 points as the script includes docstrings for each function and a main function comment that describes the overall purpose of the script. The documentation provides a clear understanding of what each part of the code is intended to do, but it lacks more comprehensive user instructions beyond the initial welcome message.\n<End of Evaluation>"
