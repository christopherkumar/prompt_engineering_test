For example, the `add` function takes two arguments `x` and `y`, but it does not handle any errors if the user enters invalid input. Similarly, the `multiply` function does not check if the input values are valid numbers. Therefore, the script could benefit from more robust error handling and validation.\n\nLogic: 2 (OK)\nThe script has some logic issues, such as not checking for invalid input values or handling edge cases. For example, if the user enters a negative number for `x` in the `add` function, the script will return an incorrect result. Similarly, if the user enters a string for `y` in the `multiply` function, the script will also return an incorrect result. Therefore, the script could benefit from more thorough error handling and edge case validation.\n\nCode Quality: 4 (Competent)\nThe code is structured in a basic way, with some adherence to PEP 8 standards. However, there are some minor readability issues, such as using `print` statements without parentheses. Therefore, the script could benefit from more consistent and idiomatic coding practices.\n\nUser Input Handling: 3 (Competent)\nThe script has some basic input handling, but it does not handle all possible input scenarios. For example, if the user enters an invalid input value for `x` or `y`, the script will crash or return an incorrect result.

        "raw_response": "Based on the provided rubric, I have assessed the Python script as follows:\n\nFunctionality: OK\nThe script performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. However, there are some minor issues with the logic and code quality that affect the functionality of the program. For example, the `divide()` function checks for zero division, but it does not handle division by zero correctly. Additionally, the program does not provide any feedback or error handling when the user enters invalid input. Overall, the script functions but has some room for improvement in terms of logic and code quality.\n\nLogic: Competent\nThe script implements basic arithmetic operations using separate functions for each operation. The logic is simple and easy to follow, but there are some minor errors and inefficiencies in the implementation. For example, the `add()` function uses a single if-else statement to handle both addition and subtraction, which could be improved by using a more specific function for each operation. Additionally, the program does not handle mixed operations (e.g., 2 + 3 * 4) correctly. Overall, the script demonstrates adequate logical structure but could benefit from further optimization and error handling.\n\nCode Quality: OK\nThe code is structured using separate functions for each operation, which makes it relatively easy to read and understand. However, there are some minor violations of PEP 8 standards, such as inconsistent indentation and lack of docstrings. Additionally, the program could benefit from more comprehensive error handling and debugging mechanisms. Overall, the code quality is adequate but could be improved with further attention to detail and adherence to best practices.\n\nUser Input Handling: Competent\nThe script handles user input correctly for basic arithmetic operations. However, there are some minor issues with validation and error handling. For example, the program does not provide any feedback or error messages when the user enters invalid input, such as a non-numeric value for the operand. Additionally, the `divide()` function checks for zero division but does not handle division by zero correctly. Overall, the script demonstrates adequate handling and validation of user input but could benefit from more comprehensive error management and feedback mechanisms.\n\nDocumentation: OK\nThe script has some basic documentation covering each function, but it lacks detail and thorough explanations. Additionally, there are some sections of code that are undocumented or lack proper comments. Overall, the documentation is adequate but could be improved with more detailed explanations and examples to help users understand how to use the program effectively.\n\nOverall, I would give this script a score of OK across all criteria, with room for improvement in terms of logic, code quality, user input handling, and documentation."

These issues detract from the script's logic score.\n\nThe code quality is also somewhat lacking, as the functions are not properly indented and there is no consistent use of whitespace throughout the script. However, the script does follow some basic PEP 8 conventions, which earns it a slightly higher score in this category.\n\nIn terms of user input handling, the script does not provide any validation or error handling for the `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` functions.
