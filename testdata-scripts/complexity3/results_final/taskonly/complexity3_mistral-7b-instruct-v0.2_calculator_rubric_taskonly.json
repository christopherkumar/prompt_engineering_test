A score of 1 is given because the defined functions do implement their intended mathematical operations.\n\nCode Quality: The code quality is very poor as there are several issues with the script. It lacks proper indentation, uses incorrect function definition syntax (missing def keyword and parentheses), and does not handle user input or include any error checking. A score of 0 is given because these issues make the code difficult to read, understand, and use effectively.\n\nUser Input Handling: The script does not handle user input at all, so a score of 0 is given.\n\nDocumentation: The script includes some basic documentation in the form of a comment describing what the calculator program is supposed to do.

The code quality is good with clear function definitions, use of a dictionary to map operations to functions, and proper handling of division by zero error. User input handling is excellent as it accepts user input in the format \"number operation number\" and converts it into arguments for the calculator functions. Documentation could be improved as there are no comments explaining what each function does or why certain design choices were made. However, the script is still functional and easy to understand without comments."
