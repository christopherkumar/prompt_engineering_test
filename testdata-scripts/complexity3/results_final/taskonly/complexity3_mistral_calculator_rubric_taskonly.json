The logic of the task is well implemented with clear functions for each arithmetic operation and a main function that handles user input and calls the appropriate operation based on user input. The code quality is good with clear variable names, use of functions, and error handling. User input handling is also well implemented with validation for invalid inputs. Documentation could be improved by adding comments to explain the purpose of each function and the flow of the program."

It performs the required operations based on user input. (Functionality: 5)\n- The logic of the task is implemented correctly with separate functions for each operation and a main function to handle user input and call the appropriate operation. (Logic: 5)\n- The code quality is good, with clear variable names, proper indentation, and separation of concerns between functions. (Code Quality: 5)\n- The script handles user input by taking two numbers as input, an operation symbol, and then performing the corresponding operation. It also checks for invalid inputs and errors. (User Input Handling: 5)\n- The documentation is present but could be improved. While there are comments describing what each function does, there is no documentation explaining the overall flow of the script or how to use it. (Documentation: 4)"
