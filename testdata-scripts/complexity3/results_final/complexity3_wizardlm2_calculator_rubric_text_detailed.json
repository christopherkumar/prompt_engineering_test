The functionality is mostly correct with some poorly written sections, such as the lack of handling for user input beyond the test cases provided.\n\nLogic: Competent\nThe logical structure for each arithmetic operation is correctly implemented. The calculations for basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are present and would work correctly if user input were handled properly. There are occasional errors or inefficiencies, such as the lack of a loop to accept user input dynamically.\n\nCode Quality: Competent\nThe code is adequately structured with functions for each operation. It follows some PEP 8 standards, but there are minor inconsistencies, like missing spaces after operators and comments that start with a hash (`#`) instead of a dot (`.`) as per PEP 8. The code is readable.\n\nUser Input Handling: OK\nThe script includes basic input handling within the test cases. It validates user input to some extent by checking for division by zero. However, it lacks dynamic user input handling outside of the test cases, which could lead to errors or crashes when unexpected input is provided.\n\nDocumentation: Competent\nEach function includes a docstring that explains its purpose and how it should be used. The script also contains comments explaining what each operation does. While the documentation provides a general overview, it lacks detail in areas such as error handling and user interaction beyond the test cases.\n\n<end of response> Functionality: Competent, Logic: Competent, Code Quality: Competent, User Input Handling: OK, Documentation: Competent <end of response>"
