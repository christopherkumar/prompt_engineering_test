The program prompts the user for input and provides clear feedback in case of errors.\n\nDocumentation: 8-12\nWhile there is some documentation provided, it could be more comprehensive and detailed. The code lacks thorough explanations and examples, which could help users understand how to use the calculator program effectively.\n\nOverall, the script scores well in most categories, with minor room for improvement in terms of code quality and documentation."
