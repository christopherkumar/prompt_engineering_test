However, it does compile and runs with some poorly written sections, as it only handles addition and multiplication.\n\nLogic: 2\nThe logical structures for the functions `add` and `multiply` are present, but there is an error in the `multiply` function where it takes a string as an argument, which will cause incorrect behavior. Basic operations are mostly correct with minor inaccuracies.\n\nCode Quality: 2\nThe code structure is basic and follows some PEP 8 standards, but there are moderate readability issues due to the lack of proper input validation and error handling for user input.\n\nUser Input Handling: 1\nThere is minimal input validation in the script, and it will frequently encounter errors and crashes on unexpected input, such as when a string is passed to the `multiply` function.\n\nDocumentation: 2\nThe script includes basic documentation covering some parts of the code, but it lacks detail and does not document all functions or potential issues with user input.\n\n<end of response> Functionality: 3, Logic: 2, Code Quality: 2, User Input Handling: 1, Documentation: 2 <end of response>"
