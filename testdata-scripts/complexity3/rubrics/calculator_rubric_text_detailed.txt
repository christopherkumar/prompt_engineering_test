In this assignment a Python script was to be developed which creates a basic calculator program that performs operations 
like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

Rubric:
Functionality
-Poor: Contains major issues.
-OK: Has one minor issue but nearly functions correctly.
-Competent: Compiles and runs with some poorly written sections.
-Excellent: Functions well with minimal issues.
-Perfect: Almost flawless in performance.
Logic
-Poor: Minimal logic implementation; numerous errors and inefficiencies. Incorrect calculations for basic operations.
-OK: Simple logical structures with some errors; basic operations are mostly correct with minor inaccuracies.
-Competent: Adequate logic flow and correct application for basic operations; occasional errors or inefficiencies.
-Excellent: Good logical structure and accurate calculations for basic operations; minor inefficiencies.
-Perfect: Excellent logical coherence, efficient and accurate calculations for all basic operations.
Code Quality
-Poor: Poorly structured and non-idiomatic code; frequent violations of PEP 8 standards.
-OK: Basic structure with some adherence to PEP 8; moderate readability issues.
-Competent: Adequately structured code with minor PEP 8 inconsistencies; readable.
-Excellent: Well-structured, readable code mostly adhering to PEP 8; minor style issues.
-Perfect: Exceptionally well-structured, highly readable, and fully PEP 8 compliant code.
User Input Handling
-Poor: Minimal input validation; frequent errors and crashes on unexpected input.
-OK: Basic input handling with some validation; occasional errors on unexpected input.
-Competent: Adequate handling and validation of user input; infrequent errors.
-Excellent: Good input handling with robust validation and error management.
-Perfect: Excellent, user-friendly input handling with comprehensive validation and error prevention.
Documentation
-Poor: Minimal or no documentation; many sections of code are undocumented.
-OK: Basic documentation covering some parts of the code; lacks detail.
-Competent: Adequate documentation providing a general overview of the subroutine functionality.
-Excellent: Good documentation with detailed explanations of most code sections.
-Perfect: Exceptional documentation throughout with thorough explanations and examples.
