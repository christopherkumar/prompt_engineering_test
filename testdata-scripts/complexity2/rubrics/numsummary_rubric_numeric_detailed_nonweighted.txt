In this assignment a Python script was to be developed which creates a subroutine that returns the 5-number summary of an input array.
The input array should be [9 27 81 86 23 30 57 31 53 0]. The script should contain the array as well as thesubroutine

Rubric:
Functionality
- 1: Contains major issues.
- 2: Has one minor issue but nearly functions correctly.
- 3: Compiles and runs with some poorly written sections.
- 4: Functions well with minimal issues.
- 5: Almost flawless in performance.
Logic
- 1: Minimal logic implementation; numerous errors and inefficiencies. The calculation of the 5-number summary is fundamentally incorrect.
- 2: Simple logical structures with some errors; the 5-number summary calculations have minor inaccuracies.
- 3: Adequate logic flow and correct mathematical application for the 5-number summary; occasional errors or inefficiencies.
- 4: Good logical structure and accurate mathematical application for the 5-number summary; minor inefficiencies.
- 5: Excellent logical coherence, efficient and accurate calculation of the 5-number summary.
Code Quality
- 1: Poorly structured and non-idiomatic code; frequent violations of PEP 8 standards.
- 2: Basic structure with some adherence to PEP 8; moderate readability issues.
- 3: Adequately structured code with minor PEP 8 inconsistencies; readable.
- 4: Well-structured, readable code mostly adhering to PEP 8; minor style issues.
- 5: Exceptionally well-structured, highly readable, and fully PEP 8 compliant code.
User Input Handling
- 1: Minimal input validation; frequent errors and crashes on unexpected input.
- 2: Basic input handling with some validation; occasional errors on unexpected input.
- 3: Adequate handling and validation of user input; infrequent errors.
- 4: Good input handling with robust validation and error management.
- 5: Excellent, user-friendly input handling with comprehensive validation and error prevention.
Documentation
- 1: Minimal or no documentation; many sections of code are undocumented.
- 2: Basic documentation covering some parts of the code; lacks detail.
- 3: Adequate documentation providing a general overview of code
functionality.
- 4: Good documentation with detailed explanations of most code sections.
- 5: Exceptional documentation throughout with thorough explanations
and examples.
