Additionally, the input array is hardcoded into the function call rather than being passed as an argument to the function.

The provided function simply returns the first five elements without any regard to their order or the actual summary statistics.

Therefore, the code quality score is 1.\n- **User Input Handling**: The script hardcodes the input array within the function definition, which means it does not handle user input as a separate parameter or in a flexible manner. It only works with the specific list provided. Hence, the user input handling score is 1.\n- **Documentation**: There is no documentation provided for the script, nor does the function include a docstring explaining its purpose, parameters, return value, or any other details.
