In this case, the script includes input validation checks for both data type and emptiness, ensuring that only valid inputs are processed.\n\nLastly, documentation is assessed by evaluating the presence and detail of comments in the code. The script includes a docstring at the function level, which provides a clear explanation of the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.
