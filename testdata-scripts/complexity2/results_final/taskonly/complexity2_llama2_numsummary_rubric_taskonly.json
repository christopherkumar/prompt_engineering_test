The script should return the 5-number summary of the input array, which includes the minimum, maximum, average, sum, and count of the elements in the array.\n\nLogic: 4/5\nThe logic of the task is implemented correctly, but there is room for improvement.

Additionally, the script does not handle user input properly, as it does not provide any way for the user to input the array.\n\nCode Quality: 3/5\nThe code quality is average. The script uses a single line of code to return the 5-number summary, which makes it easy to read and understand.

For example, the `min(numbers)` function call can be simplified to just `min numbers`, as `min` is already defined as a built-in function in Python. Additionally, the `sort()` function call is not necessary, as the list is already sorted by default when passed as an argument to the `summarize()` function.\n\nCode Quality: 3/5\nThe code quality is somewhat lacking, as there are no comments or documentation provided for the script. This makes it difficult to understand how the script works and what it does without carefully examining the code line by line.\n\nUser Input Handling: 4/5\nThe script handles user input correctly, as it takes an array as input and returns a summary of the values in the array.
