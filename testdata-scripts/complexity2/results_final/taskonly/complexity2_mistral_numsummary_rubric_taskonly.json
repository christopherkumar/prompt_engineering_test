However, it could be improved by adding more descriptive variable names and comments to make it easier for others to understand. Additionally, the script assumes that the input array has a length of at least 31 elements, which may not always be the case.\n\nUser Input Handling: The script does not handle user input as specified in the rubric. It only accepts a predefined input array and returns the 5-number summary for that array.\n\nDocumentation: The script has some documentation in the form of comments, but it could benefit from more detailed explanations of what each part of the code is doing. Additionally, there are no docstrings or other forms of external documentation provided.\n<end of response>"
