This does not affect the functionality of the script but may cause confusion when reading or testing it.\n\nThe logic flow for calculating the 5-number summary is correct, and the mathematical application is accurate. However, there are some inefficiencies in the script as it sorts the entire array to find the required quartiles instead of using a more efficient method like selecting the first, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth elements directly from the sorted array.\n\nThe code structure is adequate with minor PEP 8 inconsistencies such as missing spaces around operators and incorrect indentation in some places. The readability is good but could be improved by adding comments to explain the purpose of the script and each function or variable.\n\nUser input handling is basic, and there is no validation or error management for unexpected inputs. However, since the script does not accept user input directly, this criterion may not be as critical in this case.\n\nDocumentation is present but could use more detail to explain the purpose of the script and each function or variable. A brief explanation of what the 5-number summary is and how it is calculated would also be helpful for readers unfamiliar with the concept."
