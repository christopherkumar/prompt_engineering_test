The logic is sound, as it correctly calculates the minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum values using the provided data and appropriate statistical functions. The code quality is generally good, but there are some areas for improvement, such as potential naming conventions or formatting adjustments. User input handling is limited to a single list argument, which is acceptable given the assignment requirements.
