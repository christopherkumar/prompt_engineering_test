The subroutine is well-defined and works correctly for the provided test case.\n\nLogic: 27/30\nThe script sorts the input array before calculating the summary, which is a good practice to ensure consistent results. However, the logic behind the calculation could be improved by using a more efficient algorithm, such as using a single loop instead of two separate loops for finding the minimum and maximum values.\n\nCode Quality: 23/30\nThe code is well-structured and easy to read, but there are some areas where it could be improved. For example, the `numbers` variable is not defined inside the subroutine, so it's not clear what it represents. Additionally, the use of `print()` statement at the end of the script is unnecessary and can be removed.\n\nUser Input Handling: 16/20\nThe script does not handle user input correctly as it only takes a single-dimensional array as input and does not provide any way for the user to enter multiple arrays or to specify the input array directly.\n\nDocumentation: 8/10\nThe script does contain some documentation in the form of comments, but it could be improved by providing more detailed explanations of the subroutine's purpose and parameters. Additionally, the comments could be formatted more consistently and include more information about the variables used in the script.\n\nOverall score: 73/100"

        "raw_response": "Based on the provided rubric and the Python script you assessed, here are the scores for each category:\n\nFunctionality: 9\nThe script contains a subroutine that takes in an input array and returns a dictionary containing the five-number summary of the data. The subroutine is well-defined and easy to understand.\n\nLogic: 27\nThe script uses numpy's percentile function to calculate the Q1, median, Q3, and max values of the input array. The logic is sound and correctly implements the five-number summary calculation.\n\nCode Quality: 30\nThe code is well-organized and easy to read. It uses appropriate variable names and comments to explain its functionality. However, there are some minor issues with indentation and spacing that could be improved.\n\nUser Input Handling: 15\nThe script checks if the input data is a list of integers or floats and raises an error message if it's not. This is a good effort, but the error handling could be more robust (e.g., checking for empty lists or invalid elements).\n\nDocumentation: 10\nThe script includes a brief docstring that explains its purpose and usage. However, there is room for improvement in terms of providing more detailed documentation on how to use the subroutine and what it does.\n\nOverall score: 79"
