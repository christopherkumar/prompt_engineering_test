However, there are some minor issues with the logic flow and efficiency that prevent it from achieving a perfect score.\n\nCode Quality: 4\nThe script is reasonably well-structured and follows PEP 8 standards. It uses appropriate variable names and comments, and the code is relatively readable. However, there are some minor issues with the code quality that prevent it from achieving a perfect score.\n\nUser Input Handling: 4\nThe script handles user input correctly by checking if the input is a list of numerical values before running the calculation. It also provides appropriate error messages when the input is invalid. However, there are some minor issues with the input handling that prevent it from achieving a perfect score.\n\nDocumentation: 3\nThe script has minimal documentation, and some sections of the code are undocumented. While the script does provide some general information about its functionality, it could benefit from more detailed explanations and examples.\n\nOverall, the script receives a score of 4 in each category, resulting in an overall score of 16 out of 20."
