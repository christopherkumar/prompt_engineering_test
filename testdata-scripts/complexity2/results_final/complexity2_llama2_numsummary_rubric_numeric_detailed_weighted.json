The script also includes the input array, which is properly defined and passed to the subroutine. Therefore, the script receives a high score for functionality.\n\nLogic: 12\nThe script's logic is mostly correct, but there are some minor inaccuracies in the calculation of the 5-number summary. Specifically, the script calculates the sum of the numbers in the array and then subtracts the minimum value, which is not the correct way to calculate the 5-number summary. Therefore, the script receives a moderate score for logic.\n\nCode Quality: 18\nThe code quality is good overall, with proper indentation, consistent naming conventions, and minimal violations of PEP 8 standards. However, there are some minor style issues that prevent the script from receiving a higher score. Therefore, the script receives an average score for code quality.\n\nUser Input Handling: 10\nThe script handles user input correctly, with proper validation and error management. The script also includes comprehensive documentation, which makes it easy to understand how the code works and how to use it. Therefore, the script receives a high score for user input handling.\n\nDocumentation: 9\nThe script's documentation is good overall, but there are some areas that could be improved. For example, some sections of the code are not well-documented, and the documentation could be more detailed in some places. Therefore, the script receives an average score for documentation.\n\nOverall, the Python script receives a score of 85 out of 100."

It takes a list of numbers as input and returns a dictionary with the five-number summary statistics.\n\nLogic: 13\nThe script has adequate logical structure and accurate mathematical application for the five-number summary. There are minor inaccuracies in the calculation of the median and Q1 values, but they do not affect the overall functionality of the script.\n\nCode Quality: 19\nThe code is well-structured, readable, and mostly adheres to PEP 8 standards. There are occasional style issues, but they do not significantly impact the script's functionality or readability.\n\nUser Input Handling: 12\nThe script has adequate handling and validation of user input, and it occasionally encounters errors on unexpected input. However, these errors do not significantly affect the script's functionality.\n\nDocumentation: 10\nThe script has excellent documentation throughout, with thorough explanations and examples. The documentation is comprehensive and helps users understand how to use the script effectively.\n\nOverall, the script scores a total of 75 out of 100, with the highest scores in Functionality and Documentation, and the lowest scores in Logic and Code Quality."
