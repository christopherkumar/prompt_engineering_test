It also calls this subroutine with the given input array. However, it does not return the 5-number summary as required in the assignment. Therefore, a score of 5 is assigned for Functionality since the script can be considered partially functional as it does define and call a subroutine that takes an array as an argument.\n\nLogic: The logic of the script is incorrect as it only calculates the difference between the minimum and maximum values of the input array, but it does not return or print the 5-number summary (minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and maximum). Therefore, a score of 0 is assigned for Logic.\n\nCode Quality: The script has several issues that affect its code quality. It does not have proper indentation, which makes it difficult to read and understand. Also, the subroutine 'calc_summary' does not return any value, but it should return a list containing the 5-number summary. Therefore, a score of 0 is assigned for Code Quality.\n\nUser Input Handling: The script does not handle user input as it takes a predefined array as an argument. Therefore, a score of 0 is assigned for User Input Handling.\n\nDocumentation: The script has some documentation in the form of comments that describe what the subroutine does and how it is called. However, there is no documentation about what the 5-number summary is or how it is calculated. Therefore, a score of 5 is assigned for Documentation as the script provides some basic information about its functionality.\n<end of response>"
