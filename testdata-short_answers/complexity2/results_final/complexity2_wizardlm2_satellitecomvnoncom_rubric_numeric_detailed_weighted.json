        "raw_response": "1. Understanding of the Topic: 24/30\nThe essay addresses all three primary factors mentioned in the rubric: cost effectiveness, revisit capability, and satellite resolution. It explains how commercial satellites provide enhanced imaging capabilities that are crucial for precise crop monitoring, disease management, and resource distribution, which are key aspects of using satellite data in agriculture. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic with some nuances explored but not fully integrated into the discussion.\n\n2. Argumentation and Evidence: 43/60\nThe argument is clear and presents the primary factors well. It explains how commercial satellites are more cost-effective, have better revisit capabilities, and offer higher resolution images than non-commercial satellites. The evidence provided supports the argument effectively, though a more detailed example or data point for each factor would enhance the quality of the argumentation.\n\n3. Organization and Clarity: 8/10\nThe essay is logically organized, with each primary factor presented in a clear sequence. The transitions between the factors are smooth and effective, making it easy for readers to follow the argument and understand the advantages of using commercial satellite data over non-commercial data in agriculture."
