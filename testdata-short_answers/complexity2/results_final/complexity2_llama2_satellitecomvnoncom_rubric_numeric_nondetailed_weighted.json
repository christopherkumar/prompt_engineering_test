You have provided some relevant information about commercial satellite data, including their better resolution, which can be beneficial for agriculture. However, your answer is lacking in detail and does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the advantages of using commercial satellite data over non-commercial satellite data in agriculture.\n\nTo improve your score, you could consider addressing the following primary factors:\n\n1. Cost effectiveness: Explain how commercial satellites are more cost-effective than non-commercial satellites for agricultural purposes. Provide examples or evidence to support your claim.\n2. Timing needs: Discuss how commercial satellites have better revisit capability, which means they can capture images more frequently and at a faster rate than non-commercial satellites. Explain how this can be beneficial for agriculture, such as monitoring crop health or tracking weather patterns.\n3. Satellite resolution: Provide examples of how the higher resolution of commercial satellites can provide more detailed information about agricultural areas, such as soil moisture levels or crop yields. Explain how this increased detail can lead to better decision-making for farmers.\n\nBy addressing these primary factors and providing more detailed analysis, you can improve your score in the rubric."

However, there are some areas where you could improve your argumentation and evidence.\n\nFor example, while you mention that commercial satellites can capture images more frequently than non-commercial satellites, you don't fully explain how this is cost-effective. You simply state that it might help farmers see changes quicker without providing any supporting evidence or analysis. To improve your score in this category, you could provide more detailed explanations and examples of how commercial satellite data can be more cost-effective for agricultural applications.\n\nAdditionally, while your essay is generally well-organized and easy to follow, there are a few areas where you could improve the clarity and coherence of your writing. For example, in the second paragraph, you jump abruptly from discussing the revisit capability of commercial satellites to the topic of satellite resolution without providing any transition or connection between these ideas. To improve your score in this category, you could work on smoothing out the transitions between your ideas and providing more coherent and connected writing.\n\nOverall, your essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides some strong arguments in favor of using commercial satellite data in agriculture. With some additional attention to detail and clarity, you could improve your scores in the argumentation and evidence and organization categories."
