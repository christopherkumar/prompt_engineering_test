The advantages of cost-effectiveness, revisit capability, and better satellite resolution are mentioned, making it clear that the topic is being addressed. However, only the first factor is discussed in depth.\n\nArgumentation and Evidence: The argument is clear and adequately supported by evidence, though some points lack depth or are less convincing. The essay mentions that commercial satellites are cost-effective and deliver clearer images, but it does not explicitly state how this leads to frequent monitoring or advantages in agriculture specifically.\n\nOrganization and Clarity: The information is well organized, allowing readers to easily follow the argument. Transitions between ideas are smooth and effective."
