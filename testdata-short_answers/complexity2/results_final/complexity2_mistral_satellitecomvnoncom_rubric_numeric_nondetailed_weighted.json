However, it could have provided more detail on each advantage to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n\nArgumentation and Evidence:\nThe essay presents two arguments for using commercial satellites over non-commercial ones: higher resolution and better timing. It also suggests that a deeper discussion on cost savings would strengthen the argument. The essay provides some evidence for these points, but it could have included more specific examples or data to further support the claims.\n\nOrganization and Clarity:\nThe essay is organized around the main topic of advantages of commercial satellites in agriculture. However, it could benefit from clearer transitions between ideas and a more concise writing style for improved clarity.\n<end of response>"
