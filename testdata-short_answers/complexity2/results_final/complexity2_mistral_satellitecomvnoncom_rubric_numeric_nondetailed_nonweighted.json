Firstly, cost effectiveness is a significant advantage of commercial satellites. Farmers can access high-resolution images more frequently and affordably through commercial satellite providers. This is important as timely information about crop health and growth patterns can lead to improved decision-making and increased yields (Costello, 2018).\n\nSecondly, commercial satellites have better revisit capabilities than non-commercial satellites. This means that they can capture images more frequently, allowing farmers to monitor their crops in near real-time. This is crucial for identifying issues such as crop stress or disease outbreaks early on, enabling prompt intervention and minimizing potential losses (FAO, 2019).\n\nLastly, commercial satellites offer higher satellite resolution than non-commercial satellites. This enables farmers to identify smaller features on their land, such as individual crops or irrigation systems. This level of detail is essential for making informed decisions about crop management and optimization (USGS, 2021).\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReferences:\nCostello, J.
