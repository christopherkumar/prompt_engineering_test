The argumentation is supported by specific examples or evidence, such as \"designed to be more cost-effective\" and \"deliver clearer images.\" However, the script could benefit from a more detailed explanation or elaboration on how these advantages translate to practical benefits for farmers or agriculture in general.\n\nThe organization and clarity of the script are excellent, with each advantage being presented clearly and concisely in separate sentences. The use of transition words like \"one of the primary advantages\" and \"another advantage\" helps to establish a logical flow to the essay. Overall, the script effectively addresses the primary factors outlined in the rubric."
