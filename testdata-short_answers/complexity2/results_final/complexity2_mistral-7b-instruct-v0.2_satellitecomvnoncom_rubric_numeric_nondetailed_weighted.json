However, the explanation could be more detailed and explicit about how these factors lead to cost savings and improved agriculture productivity. The argumentation is present but not fully developed, as the connection between image quality, revisit capability, and cost effectiveness is not clearly stated. The essay is organized and clear, but the lack of a clear introduction and conclusion detracts from its overall clarity."
