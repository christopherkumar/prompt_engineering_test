Your argumentation is clear and well-structured, but could benefit from more evidence to support your claims. Additionally, your organization and clarity are generally good, but there are some areas where the flow of ideas could be improved.\n\nIn terms of the primary factors, you have addressed two of them: commercial satellites are more cost-effective and have better satellite resolution. However, you could have provided more insight into why these factors matter for agriculture. For example, you could have discussed how commercial satellites can provide more frequent and detailed imagery, which can help farmers make more informed decisions about crop management and resource allocation.\n\nOverall, your essay shows some potential but could benefit from further development and refinement."
