Firstly, commercial satellites provide higher resolution images, enabling farmers to accurately identify issues such as pest infestations or nutrient deficiencies. Additionally, commercial satellites are more cost effective and have a better revisit capability, ensuring timely access to crucial agricultural information. These capabilities make commercial satellites an ideal choice for modern farming practices."
