Firstly, they are more cost effective than their non-commercial counterparts. Commercial satellites have access to advanced technology and economies of scale, allowing them to provide imaging services at a lower cost per acre compared to non-commercial missions. Secondly, commercial satellites boast a better revisit capability, meaning they can capture images of the same area more frequently. This capability is crucial for agriculture as it allows farmers to monitor crop health, soil conditions, and irrigation needs on a timely basis. Finally, commercial satellites have better satellite resolution, providing farmers with more detailed and accurate imagery of their fields."

The writer clearly explains the cost-effectiveness and revisit capabilities of commercial satellites, highlighting their suitability for agricultural use. However, the essay lacks depth in exploring the exact financial impact of commercial satellite data in agriculture. The argument is clear and adequately supported by evidence, but some points could be more convincing. The organization is logical, with smooth transitions between ideas."
