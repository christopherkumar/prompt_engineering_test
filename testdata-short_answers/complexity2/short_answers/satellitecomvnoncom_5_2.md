The utility of commercial satellites in agriculture stems primarily from their enhanced revisit capability, which is pivotal during crucial growth stages of crops. This capability, along with cost-effective deployment, allows for frequent monitoring and rapid response to any agricultural anomalies. High-resolution imaging further assists in detailed analysis of crop conditions, facilitating targeted interventions that optimize yield and resource use.
