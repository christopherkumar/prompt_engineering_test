Commercial satellites offer significant advantages in agricultural applications due to their cost-effectiveness, which allows for more frequent data acquisition without prohibitive expenses. Coupled with their ability to revisit specific areas quickly, they ensure timely monitoring of crops which is essential for managing irrigation and pest control. Furthermore, the superior resolution of commercial satellites provides detailed imagery that can discern fine variations in crop health, enabling precise agricultural interventions.
