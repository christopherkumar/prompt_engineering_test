Commercial satellites are pivotal in agriculture for their ability to deliver high-resolution images cost-effectively and with great temporal frequency. This capability allows for detailed and continuous crop monitoring, which is essential for identifying and mitigating issues before they affect yield. The ability to quickly revisit areas also aids in tracking the effectiveness of interventions, making commercial satellites indispensable in modern farming.
