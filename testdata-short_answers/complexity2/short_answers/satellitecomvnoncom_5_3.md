In precision agriculture, the use of commercial satellites is transformative, offering three distinct advantages: cost efficiency, frequent revisits, and superior image resolution. These satellites provide detailed and regular observations of crop health at a lower cost, making high-frequency, high-resolution satellite data accessible for farmers, which supports advanced analytical techniques for crop monitoring and management.
