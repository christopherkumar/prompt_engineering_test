The purpose of the hoods on the first generation weed sensors was to normalize the lighting conditions during image capture, which is crucial for the accuracy of weed identification. This design choice simplified the software development process by reducing the variables the software needed to interpret, thus enhancing the overall performance and reliability of the weed detection system.
