It also explains how this design choice simplified software development by reducing variables for the software to interpret, enhancing overall performance and reliability. The argument is clear, well-defined, and logically structured, with relevant evidence provided to support the claims. The organization of ideas is effective, allowing readers to easily follow the argument, and transitions between ideas are smooth."
