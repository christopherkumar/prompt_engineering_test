        "raw_response": "Understanding of the Topic: OK\nArgumentation and Evidence: OK\nOrganization and Clarity: OK\n\nBased on your essay, you have provided a brief answer to the question why all first-generation weed spot and spray sensors had a hood. Your response is clear and easy to follow, but it lacks depth and detail in its explanation. You have mentioned that the hoods were probably for protecting the sensors from rain or something similar, but you have not provided any evidence or reasoning to support this claim.\n\nTo improve your score, consider providing more specific reasons why the manufacturers might have included hoods on these sensors. For example, you could discuss how the hoods help to protect the sensors from dust and debris, which can interfere with their performance. You could also provide examples of how the hoods help to improve the accuracy of the sensors by reducing the impact of changing light conditions throughout the day.\n\nIn terms of organization and clarity, your essay is easy to follow, but it could benefit from more structure and transitions between paragraphs. Consider breaking your response into clear sections or points, and use transitional phrases to connect each section to the next. This will help to make your argument more coherent and easier to follow.\n\nOverall, while your essay is a good effort, it could benefit from more depth and detail in its explanation of why the hoods were included on first-generation weed spot and spray sensors."
