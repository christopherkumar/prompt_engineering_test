You mention that the hoods were probably for protecting the sensors from rain or something, which is a valid point. However, you do not provide any explanation for why this is the case, and you do not address the issue of consistent lighting conditions. To improve your score in this category, make sure to provide a clear and concise explanation for why the hoods were necessary.\n* Argumentation and Evidence: Your essay provides some evidence to support your claim, but it could be more comprehensive. You mention that the sensors were probably protected from rain, but you do not provide any information about how this would affect their performance or consistency. To improve your score in this category, make sure to provide more specific and relevant evidence to support your argument.\n* Organization and Clarity: Your essay is somewhat organized, but there are some areas where the transitions could be smoother.
