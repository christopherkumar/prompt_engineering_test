Small specialty robots are instrumental in agriculture for their ability to lessen soil compaction, thereby preventing soil degradation and promoting better crop growth. Their automated nature reduces the need for manual labor, allowing for more efficient resource allocation. Moreover, their precision in applying chemicals not only cuts costs but also minimizes the ecological footprint of farming operations.
