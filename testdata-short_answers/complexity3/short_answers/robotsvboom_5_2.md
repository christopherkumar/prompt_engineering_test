Utilizing small specialty robots over large boom sprayers presents multiple advantages: they minimize soil compaction, preserving the soil's ecological balance and enhancing plant health. These robots also automate processes, reducing labor costs, and precisely target areas for treatment, which decreases chemical usage and environmental impact, making them a sustainable choice for modern farming.
