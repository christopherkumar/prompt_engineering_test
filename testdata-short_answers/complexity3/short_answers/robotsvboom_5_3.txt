The adoption of small specialty robots revolutionizes agricultural practices by reducing soil compaction, which in turn promotes healthier crop roots and better yield. Furthermore, these robots automate the spraying process, cutting down on labor costs, and their precision significantly reduces the volume of chemicals used, which is both cost-effective and environmentally friendly.
