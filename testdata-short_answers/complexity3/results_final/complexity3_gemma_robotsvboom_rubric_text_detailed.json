One key benefit is the reduction of soil compaction in the field. By deploying robots instead of heavy machinery, farmers can minimize damage to the soil structure, allowing for improved drainage and root growth. Additionally, the use of small robots significantly reduces labour requirements in agriculture. These robots can perform tasks such as weed control and pest management with greater precision and efficiency than humans, freeing up farmers to focus on other aspects of their operations. Furthermore, employing small robots allows for increased savings on chemical use, as they can apply pesticides and fertilizers precisely where needed, reducing waste and environmental impact."
