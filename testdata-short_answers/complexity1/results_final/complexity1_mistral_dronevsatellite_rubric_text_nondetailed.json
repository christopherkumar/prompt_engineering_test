The statement \"Drones are just better than satellites because they can go whenever and don't need specific things to work\" does not directly address the primary factors mentioned in the rubric: higher resolution images, timing needs for image capture, and absence of required sensors on drones. Additionally, the essay lacks proper organization and clarity as it only presents a single statement without any clear connection to the topic or the criteria provided in the rubric."
