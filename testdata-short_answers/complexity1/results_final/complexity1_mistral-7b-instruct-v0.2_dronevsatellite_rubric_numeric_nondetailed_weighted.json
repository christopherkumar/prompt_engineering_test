However, the essay could have been more comprehensive by explicitly stating that drones are physically closer to the site and do not need to be equipped with specific sensors.\n\nThe argumentation and evidence presented is sufficient for the given topic, but could benefit from additional details or examples to strengthen the points made. For instance, providing specific resolution capabilities of drones versus satellites would add more weight to the argument about higher resolution images. Similarly, discussing cost savings in terms of revisit frequency could be added to support the point about more frequent image capture.\n\nThe organization and clarity of the essay is satisfactory as it presents the main points clearly and logically. However, there are some areas for improvement such as using more precise language and ensuring consistent use of terminology throughout the essay. Additionally, providing a clear introduction and conclusion would enhance the overall structure and flow of the essay."
