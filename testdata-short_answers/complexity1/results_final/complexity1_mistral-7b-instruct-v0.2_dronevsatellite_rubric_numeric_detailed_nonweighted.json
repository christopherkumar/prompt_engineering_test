However, it fails to address the other two primary factors: higher resolution images and the absence of specific sensor requirements for drones. Therefore, the understanding of the topic score is set at a 2.\n\nRegarding argumentation and evidence, the essay does not provide any relevant or credible evidence to support its claim that drones are better than satellites. The argument lacks depth and clarity, making it difficult to assess its merit. Consequently, the argumentation and evidence score is set at a 1.\n\nLastly, the organization and clarity of the essay is rated as a 3.

However, it does not explicitly discuss the third primary factor (revisit capability). Therefore, the understanding of the topic score is set to 3.\n\nThe argumentation in the essay is clear and adequately supported by evidence, though it could benefit from more depth and elaboration on how drones provide higher resolution images compared to satellites. Thus, the argumentation and evidence score is set to 4.\n\nThe organization and clarity of the essay are excellent as the ideas flow smoothly and the writing is clear and easy to follow.
