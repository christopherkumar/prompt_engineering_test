Higher resolution images: Drones are capable of providing higher resolution images compared to satellites, as they are physically closer to the site. This allows farmers to gather more detailed information about their fields and crops.\n2. Better timing needs: Drones have a revisit capability that is faster than satellites, which means they can capture images more frequently and in real-time. This is particularly useful for monitoring crop health and growth, as farmers can quickly identify any issues and take action.\n3. No need for specific sensors: Drones do not require specialized sensors to gather data, unlike satellites which often require additional equipment to collect the desired information. This makes drones a more cost-effective option for agricultural monitoring.\n\nOverall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents a well-supported argument with relevant evidence. The organization and clarity of the essay are also excellent, making it easy to follow and understand."
