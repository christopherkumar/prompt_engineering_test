However, it could have been more comprehensive by explicitly stating that drones provide higher resolution images due to their proximity to the site.\n\nThe argumentation is present but not fully developed, as it only touches upon two advantages of using drones over satellites in agriculture. The essay lacks sufficient evidence to support these arguments, such as data or examples.\n\nThe organization and clarity of the essay are satisfactory, with a clear introduction to the topic and a logical flow of ideas. However, the sentence \"This makes them adaptable and effective for various farming needs\" could be more specific by explaining how drones' adaptability benefits agriculture."
