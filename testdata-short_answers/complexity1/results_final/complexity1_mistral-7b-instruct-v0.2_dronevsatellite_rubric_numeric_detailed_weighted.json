        "raw_response": " <start of response>\nUnderstanding of the Topic: 25, Argumentation and Evidence: 49, Organization and Clarity: 10\n</end of response>\n\nThe essay addresses all three primary factors: drones provide higher resolution images due to their proximity to the site, they offer better timing for image capture with revisit capability, and they can be equipped with various sensors without the need for specific ones. The essay provides clear and relevant evidence to support each point, making a compelling argument for the advantages of using drones over satellites in agriculture. The organization and clarity of the essay are excellent, with smooth transitions between ideas and clear progression of thoughts."
