However, it only mentions this advantage without explicitly stating that drones can provide higher resolution images due to their proximity to the site. The essay also fails to mention the other advantages of drones, such as their revisit capability and the lack of need for specific sensors.\n\nThe argumentation and evidence in the essay is limited to one sentence about the advantage of immediate imaging. There is no clear connection made between this advantage and how it benefits agriculture specifically. Additionally, there is no concrete evidence provided to support the claims made in the essay.\n\nThe organization and clarity of the essay is strong. The main idea is presented clearly in the first sentence, and the rest of the essay focuses on explaining this idea in more detail. The language used is clear and concise, making it easy for the reader to follow along."
