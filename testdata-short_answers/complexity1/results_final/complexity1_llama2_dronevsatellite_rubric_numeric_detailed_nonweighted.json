More evidence could have been provided to support the argument and make it more convincing.\n\nOrganization and Clarity: 3/5\nThe essay is somewhat organized, with each paragraph addressing a different aspect of the topic. However, the transitions between paragraphs are not always smooth, and the overall organization could be improved. The essay could benefit from more clarity in its structure and language, making it easier for readers to follow the argument.\n\nOverall score: 3/5"
