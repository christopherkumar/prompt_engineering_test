It clearly explains that drones can provide higher resolution images due to their proximity to the site, which is crucial for precision farming. The essay also highlights the advantage of drones' revisit capability, allowing for better timing and more frequent image capture than satellites. Additionally, it points out the versatility of drones in being equipped with various sensors, which is an important aspect of their adaptability to different agricultural needs.\n\nThe argumentation is insightful, as it connects the mentioned factors with tangible benefits such as improved crop yields and reduced environmental impact. The evidence provided supports the claims made, demonstrating a clear understanding of how drones can be advantageous over satellites in agriculture.\n\nThe organization and clarity of the essay are commendable, with a logical flow that allows readers to easily follow the argument. The transitions between points are smooth and effective, contributing to the overall coherence of the essay."
