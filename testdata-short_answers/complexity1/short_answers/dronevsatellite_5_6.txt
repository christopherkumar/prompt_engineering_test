Drones transform agricultural monitoring with their superior image quality and operational flexibility. By operating closer to the ground, drones provide detailed visual data that can detect early signs of stress in plants, information that is crucial for sustainable farming practices. Their quick revisit capability allows for continuous monitoring of crop conditions, enabling farmers to apply water, pesticides, and fertilizers more efficiently and only as needed, thus reducing environmental impact and cost.
