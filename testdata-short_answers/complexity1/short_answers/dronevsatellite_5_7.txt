Utilizing drones in agriculture offers a distinct advantage over satellites through both enhanced image resolution and the ability to frequently update this data. This high-resolution imaging is critical for precision farming, where detailed insights into plant health can dictate the timing and scope of interventions. Additionally, the flexibility of drones to carry various sensor types means that they can be quickly reconfigured for different tasks, providing a level of versatility that satellites cannot match, which is essential for integrated pest management and variable rate dispersal.
