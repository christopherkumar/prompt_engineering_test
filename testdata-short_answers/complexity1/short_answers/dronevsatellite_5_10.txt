The deployment of drones in agriculture marks a significant improvement over satellite-based monitoring, offering both higher resolution imagery and greater temporal flexibility. These drones capture detailed, actionable data that can guide precision farming techniques, such as the targeted application of fertilizers and pesticides, leading to improved crop yields and reduced environmental impact. Furthermore, their ability to be equipped with a variety of sensors makes them adaptable to a range of agricultural conditions, ensuring that the data collected is both relevant and immediately useful.
