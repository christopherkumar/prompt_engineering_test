The use of drones in agricultural monitoring surpasses satellite capabilities in several key areas. First, drones operate at lower altitudes, allowing for imagery with higher resolution that is critical for detecting subtle variations in crop health that satellites might miss. Moreover, their rapid deployment capability enables precise timing for image capture that aligns perfectly with agricultural schedules, not constrained by orbital cycles. Drones also offer versatility in sensor attachments, making them adaptable to a variety of agricultural needs without requiring specialized equipment.
