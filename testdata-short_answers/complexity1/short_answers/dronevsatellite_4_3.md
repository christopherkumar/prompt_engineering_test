Drones are particularly useful in agriculture for their ability to revisit areas frequently, a feature that satellites cannot match due to their predetermined orbits. This makes drones ideal for tracking crop growth and responding to issues as they arise. Their close-range imaging also offers greater detail than satellite photos, enhancing decision-making for farmers.
