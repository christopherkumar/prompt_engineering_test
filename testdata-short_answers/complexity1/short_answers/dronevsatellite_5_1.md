Drones offer unparalleled advantages in agriculture over satellites, primarily through their ability to provide ultra-high-resolution images due to their proximity to crop fields. This capability is crucial for identifying minute details like early signs of disease or pest infestation, which are vital for preventive management. Additionally, drones' ability to frequently revisit the same location allows for real-time monitoring and immediate intervention, significantly enhancing crop yield and health.
