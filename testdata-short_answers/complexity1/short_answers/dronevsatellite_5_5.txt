Leveraging drones for agricultural surveillance provides critical advantages over satellite imaging. High-resolution drone imagery enables detailed assessments of crop health at a granular level, facilitating early detection of irregularities that could evolve into larger issues. Furthermore, drones' ability to rapidly revisit sites makes them indispensable for tracking the progression of these issues and verifying the effectiveness of interventions. This aspect is particularly beneficial for adaptive management practices where quick responses are necessary to mitigate risks and optimize crop yields.
