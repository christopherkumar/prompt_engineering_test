Drones significantly outperform satellites in agricultural applications by offering higher resolution images and greater temporal flexibility. The proximity of drones to crop fields allows for detailed visual data that is essential for precise soil health analysis and irrigation planning. Additionally, the capability to quickly adjust flight plans empowers farmers with timely data following unpredictable weather, ensuring that decision-making is based on the most current field conditions. This adaptability extends to sensor technology, where drones can be fitted with various sensors depending on the specific agricultural requirement, thereby optimizing resource allocation and crop health.
