In agriculture, drones provide a significant advantage with their high-resolution imaging capabilities, stemming from their operation at lower altitudes compared to satellites. This allows for precise assessments of crop conditions. Moreover, the flexibility of drones to be equipped with various sensors as needed makes them highly adaptable for different agricultural applications.
