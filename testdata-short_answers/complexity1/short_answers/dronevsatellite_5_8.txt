The strategic use of drones in agriculture far exceeds the capabilities of satellite imaging, particularly in their ability to produce detailed, high-resolution aerial photographs. These photographs are crucial for identifying small-scale problems before they become widespread. Drones also excel in their operational flexibility, capable of performing targeted imaging based on specific agricultural cycles, thereby providing farmers with timely information that can lead to more informed and precise farming decisions.
