In precision agriculture, drones represent a technological leap over satellites. By flying at lower altitudes, drones can capture images with much finer detail, essential for accurate crop density assessments and nutrient management. Their operational flexibility ensures images can be taken precisely when needed, crucial during critical growth stages or after significant weather events. This timeliness and the ability to equip drones with customized sensors tailored to specific agricultural tasks enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of crop management strategies.
